<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This little book is an attempt to compress into a few pages an account
of the general evolution of Greek biological and medical knowledge. The
section on <i>Aristotle</i> appears here for the first time. The remaining
sections are reprinted from articles contributed to a volume <i>The
Legacy of Greece</i> edited by Mr. R. W. Livingstone, the only changes
being the correction of a few errors and the addition of some further
references to the literature.</p>

<p>In quoting from the great Aristotelian biological treatises, the
<i>History of Animals</i>, the <i>Parts of Animals</i>, and the <i>Generation of
Animals</i>, I have usually availed myself of the text of the Oxford
translation edited by Mr. W. D. Ross. For the <i>De anima</i> I have used
the version of Mr. R. D. Hicks.</p>

<p>I have to thank my friends Mr. R. W. Livingstone, Dr. E. T. Withington,
and Mr. J. D. Beazley for a number of suggestions. To my colleague
Professor Arthur Platt I have to record my gratitude not only for
much help in the writing of these chapters but also for his kindness
and patience in reading and rereading the work both in manuscript and
proof. I am specially indebted, moreover, to the notes appended to his
translation of the <i>Generation of Animals</i>.</p>

   <h2>GREEK BIOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Before Aristotle</i></h3>

<p>What is science? It is a question that cannot be answered easily, nor
perhaps answered at all. None of the definitions seem to cover the
field exactly; they are either too wide or too narrow. But we can
see science in its growth and we can say that being a process it can
exist only as growth. Where does the science of biology begin? Again
we cannot say, but we can watch its evolution and its progress. Among
the Greeks the accurate observation of living forms, which is at least
one of the essentials of biological science, goes back very far. The
word <i>Biology</i>, used in our sense, would, it is true, have been an
impossibility among them, for <i>bios</i> refers to the life of man and
could not be applied, except in a strained or metaphorical sense, to
that of other living things.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
But the <i>ideas</i> we associate with the
word are clearly developed in Greek philosophy and the foundations of
biology are of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The Greek people had many roots, racial, cultural, and spiritual, and
from them all they inherited various powers and qualities and derived
various ideas and traditions. The most suggestive source for our
purpose is that of the Minoan race whom they dispossessed and whose
lands they occupied. That highly gifted people exhibited in all stages
of its development a marvellous power of graphically representing
animal forms, of which the famous Cretan friezes, Vaphio cups (<a href="#FIG_05">Fig. 5</a>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and Mycenean lions provide well-known examples. It is difficult not to
believe that the Minoan element, entering into the mosaic of peoples
that we call the Greeks, was in part at least responsible for the like
graphic power developed in the Hellenic world, though little contact
has yet been demonstrated between Minoan and archaic Greek Art.</p>

<p>For the earliest biological achievements of Greek peoples we have
to rely largely on information gleaned from artistic remains. It
is true that we have a few fragments of the works of both Ionian
and Italo-Sicilian philosophers, and in them we read of theoretical
speculation as to the nature of life and of the soul, and we can thus
form some idea of the first attempts of such workers as Alcmaeon of
Croton (<i>c.</i> 500 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) to lay bare the structure of animals
by dissection.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The pharmacopœia also of some of the earliest works of the Hippocratic
collection betrays considerable knowledge of both native and foreign
plants.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Moreover, scattered through the pages of Herodotus and other early
writers is a good deal of casual information concerning animals and
plants, though such material is second-hand and gives us little
information concerning the habit of exact observation that is the
necessary basis of science.

           Lioness and young from an Ionian vase of the sixth century
           <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> found at Caere in Southern Etruria
           (Louvre, Salle E, No. 298), from <i>Le Dessin des Animaux en Grèce d’après les
            vases peints</i>, by J. Morin, Paris (Renouard), 1911. The animal is
            drawing itself up to attack its hunters. The scanty mane, the form
            of the paws, the udders, and the dentition are all heavily though
            accurately represented.</p>

         vase (Fig. 1), after Morin. Note the careful way in which the artist
         has distinguished the molar from the cutting teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>Something more is, however, revealed by early Greek Art. We are in
possession of a series of vases of the seventh and sixth centuries
before the Christian era showing a closeness of observation of
animal forms that tells of a people awake to the study of nature.
We have thus portrayed for us a number of animals—plants seldom or
never appear—and among the best rendered are wild creatures; we see
antelopes quietly feeding or startled at a sound, birds flying or
picking worms from the ground, fallow deer forcing their way through
thickets, browsing peacefully, or galloping away, boars facing the
hounds and dogs chasing hares, wild cattle forming their defensive
circle, hawks seizing their prey. Many of these exhibit minutely
accurate observation. The very direction of the hairs on the animals’
coats has sometimes been closely studied, and often the muscles are
well rendered. In some cases even the dentition has been found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
accurately portrayed, as in a sixth century representation on an Ionian
vase of a lioness—an animal then very rare on the Eastern Mediterranean
littoral, though still well known in Babylonia, Syria, and Asia Minor.
The details of the work show that the artist must have examined the
animal in captivity (Figs. <a href="#FIG_01">1</a> and <a href="#FIG_02">2</a>).</p>

<p class="space-above2">Animal paintings of this order are found
scattered over the Greek world with special centres or schools in such
places as Cyprus, Boeotia, or Chalcis. The very name for a painter in
Greek, <i>zoographos</i>, recalls the attention paid to living forms. By the
fifth century, in representing them as in other departments of Art, the
supremacy of Attica had asserted itself, and there are many beautiful
Attic vase-paintings of animals to place by the side of the magnificent
horses’ heads of the Parthenon (<a href="#FIG_06">Fig. 6</a>). In Attica, too,
was early developed a characteristic and closely accurate type of representation
of marine forms, and this attained a wider vogue in Southern Italy in
the fourth century. From the latter period a number of dishes and vases
have come down to us bearing a large variety of fish forms, portrayed
with an exactness that is interesting in view of the attention to marine
creatures in the surviving literature of Aristotelian origin (<a href="#FIG_03">Fig. 3</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>These artistic products are more than a mere reflex of the daily life
of the people. The habits and positions of animals are observed by the
hunter, as are the forms and colours of fish by the fisherman; but
the methods of huntsman and fisher do not account for the accurate
portrayal of a lion’s dentition, the correct numbering of a fish’s
scales or the close study of the lie of the feathers on the head, and
the pads on the feet, of a bird of prey (<a href="#FIG_04">Fig. 4</a>). With
observations such as these we are in the presence of something worthy of the
name <i>Biology</i>. Though but little literature on that topic earlier than
the writings of Aristotle has come down to us, yet both the character
of his writings and such paintings and pictures as these, suggest the
existence of a strong interest and a wide literature, biological in the
modern sense, antecedent to the fourth century.</p>

<p class="space-above2">Greek science, however, exhibits throughout
its history a peculiar characteristic differentiating it from the
modern scientific standpoint. Most of the work of the Greek scientist
was done in relation to man. Nature interested him mainly in relation
to himself. The Greek scientific and philosophic world was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
anthropocentric world, and this comes out in the overwhelming mass
of medical as distinct from biological writings that have come down
to us. Such, too, is the sentiment expressed by the poets in their
descriptions of the animal creation:</p>

<p>It is thus not surprising that our first systematic treatment of
animals is in a practical medical work, the περὶ διαίτης, <i>On regimen</i>,
of the Hippocratic Collection. This very peculiar treatise dates from
the later part of the fifth century. It is strongly under the influence
of Heracleitus (<i>c.</i> 540-475) and contains many points of view which
reappear in later philosophy. All animals, according to it, are formed
of fire and water, nothing is born and nothing dies, but there is a
perpetual and eternal revolution of things, so that change itself
is the only reality. Man’s nature is but a parallel to that of the
universal nature, and the arts of man are but an imitation or reflex
of the natural arts or, again, of the bodily functions. The soul, a
mixture of water and fire, consumes itself in infancy and old age, and
increases during adult life. Here, too, we meet with that singular
doctrine, not without bearing on the course of later biological
thought, that in the foetus all parts are formed simultaneously. On
the proportion of fire and water in the body all depends, sex, temper,
temperament, intellect. Such speculative ideas separate this book from
the sober method of the more typical Hippocratic medical works with
which indeed it has little in common.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
After having discussed these theoretical matters the work turns to its
own practical concerns, and in the course of setting out the natures
of foods gives in effect a rough classification of animals. These are
set forth in groups, and from among the larger groups only the reptiles
and insects are missing. The list has been described, perhaps hardly
with justification, as the <i>Coan classificatory system</i>. We have here,
indeed, no <i>system</i> in the sense in which that word is now applied to
the animal kingdom, but we have yet some sort of definite arrangement
of animals according to their supposed natures. The passage opens with
mammals, which are divided into domesticated and wild, the latter being
mentioned in order according to size, next follow the land-birds,
then the water-fowl, and then the fishes. These fish are divided into
(1) the haunters of the shore, (2) the free-swimming forms, (3) the
cartilaginous fishes or Selachii, which are not so named but are placed
together, (4) the mud-loving forms, and (5) the fresh-water fish.
Finally come invertebrates arranged in some sort of order according to
their structure. The characteristic feature of the ‘classification’ is
the separation of the fish from the remaining vertebrates and of the
invertebrates from both. Of the fifty animals named no less than twenty
are fish, about a fifth of the number studied by Aristotle, but we must
remember that here only edible species are mentioned. The existence of
the work shows at least that in the fifth century there was already a
close and accurate study of animal forms, a study that may justly be
called scientific. The predominance of fish and their classification
in greater detail than the other groups is not an unexpected feature.
The Mediterranean is especially rich in these forms, the Greeks were a
maritime people, and Greek literature is full of imagery drawn from the
fisher’s craft. From Minoan to Byzantine times the variety, beauty, and
colour of fish made a deep impression on Greek minds as reflected in
their art.</p>

<p>Much more important however for subsequent biological development, than
such observations on the nature and habits of animals, is the service
that the Hippocratic physicians rendered to Anatomy and to Physiology,
departments in which the structure of man and of the domesticated
animals stands apart from that of the rest of the animal kingdom. It
is with the nature and constitution of man that most of the surviving
early biological writings are concerned, and in these departments are
unmistakable tendencies towards systematic arrangement of the material.
Thus we have division and description of the body in sevens from the
periphery to the centre and from the vertex to the sole of the foot,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
or a division into four regions or zones.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The teaching concerning the four elements and four humours too became
of great importance and some of it was later adopted by Aristotle.
We also meet numerous mechanical explanations of bodily structures,
comparisons between anatomical conditions encountered in related
animals, experiments on living creatures,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
systematic incubation of hen’s eggs for the study of their development,
parallels drawn between the development of plants and of human and
animal embryos, theories of generation, among which is that which
was afterwards called ‘pangenesis’—discussion of the survival of the
stronger over the weaker—almost our survival of the fittest—and a
theory of inheritance of acquired characters.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
All these things show not only extensive knowledge but also an attempt
to apply such knowledge to human needs. When we consider how even in
later centuries biology was linked with medicine, and how powerful and
fundamental was the influence of the Hippocratic writings, not only
on their immediate successors in antiquity, but also on the Middle
Ages and right into the nineteenth century, we shall recognize the
significance of these developments.</p>

Such was the character of biological thought within the fifth century,
and a generation inspired by this movement produced some noteworthy
works in the period which immediately followed. In the treatise περὶ
τροφῆς, <i>On nourishment</i>, which may perhaps be dated about 400
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, we learn of the pulse for the first time in
Greek medical literature, and read of a physiological system which lasted until
the time of Harvey, with the arteries arising from the heart and the veins
from the liver. Of about the same date is a work περὶ καρδίης, <i>On the
heart</i>, which describes the ventricles as well as the great vessels and
their valves, and compares the heart of animals with that of man.</p>

<p>A little later, perhaps 390 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, is the treatise
περὶ σαρκῶν, <i>On muscles</i>, which contains much more than its title suggests.
It has the old system of sevens and, inspired perhaps by the philosophy
of Heracleitus (<i>c.</i> 540-475), describes the heart as sending air,
fire, and movement to the different parts of the body through the
vessels which are themselves constantly in movement. The infant in its
mother’s womb is believed to draw in air and fire through its mouth
and to eat <i>in utero</i>. The action of air on the blood is compared
to its action on fire. In contrast to some of the other Hippocratic
treatises the central nervous system is in the background; much
attention, however, is given to the special senses. The brain resounds
during audition. The olfactory nerves are hollow, lead to the brain,
and convey volatile substances to it which cause it to secrete mucus.
The eyes also have been examined, and their coats and humours roughly
described; an allusion, the first in literature, is perhaps made to the
crystalline lens, and the eyes of animals are compared with those of
man. There is evidence not only of dissection but of experiment, and in
efforts to compare the resistance of various tissues to such processes
as boiling, we may see the small beginning of chemical physiology.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>An abler work than any of these, but exhibiting less power of
observation is a treatise, περὶ γονῆς, <i>On generation</i>, that may
perhaps be dated about 380 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It exhibits a writer of much philosophic power, very anxious for
physiological explanations, but hampered by ignorance of physics. He
has, in fact, the weaknesses and in a minor degree the strength of
his successor Aristotle, of whose great work on generation he gives
us a foretaste. He sets forth in considerable detail a doctrine of
pangenesis, not wholly unlike that of Darwin. In order to explain the
phenomena of inheritance he supposes that vessels reach the seed,
carrying with them samples from all parts of the body. He believes
that channels pass from all the organs to the brain and then to the
spinal marrow (or to the marrow direct), thence to the kidneys and
on to the genital organs; he believes, too, that he knows the actual
location of one such channel, for he observes, wrongly, that incision
behind the ears, by interrupting the passage, leads to impotence. As an
outcome of this theory he is prepared to accept inheritance of acquired
characters. The embryo develops and breathes by material transmitted
from the mother through the umbilical cord. We encounter here also a
very detailed description of a specimen of exfoliated <i>membrana mucosa
uteri</i> which our author mistakes for an embryo, but his remarks at least
exhibit the most eager curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The author of this work on generation is thus a ‘biologist’ in the
modern sense, and among the passages exhibiting him in this light is
his comparison of the human embryo with the chick. ‘The embryo is in a
membrane in the centre of which is the navel through which it draws and
gives its breath, and the membranes arise from the umbilical cord....
The structure of the child you will find from first to last as I have
already described.... If you wish, try this experiment: take twenty
or more eggs and let them be incubated by two or more hens. Then each
day from the second to that of hatching remove an egg, break it, and
examine it. You will find exactly as I say, for the nature of the bird
can be likened to that of man. The membranes [you will see] proceed
from the umbilical cord, and all that I have said on the subject of
the infant you will find in a bird’s egg, and one who has made these
observations will be surprised to find an umbilical cord in a bird’s
egg.’<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The same interest that he exhibits for the development of
man and animals he shows also for plants.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> ‘A seed laid in the ground fills itself with the
juices there contained, for the soil contains in itself juices of every
nature for the nourishment of plants. Thus filled with juice the seed
is distended and swells, and thereby the power (= faculty ἡ δὗύναμις)
diffused in the seed is compressed by living principle (pneuma) and
juice, and bursting the seed becomes the first leaves. But a time comes
when these leaves can no longer get nourished from the juices in the
seed. Then the seed and the leaves erupt, for urged by the leaves the
seed sends down that part of its power which is yet concentrated within
it and so the roots are produced as an extension of the leaves. When
at last the plant is well rooted below and is drawing its nutriment
from the earth, then the whole grain disappears, being absorbed, save
for the husk, which is the most solid part; and even that, decomposing
in the earth, ultimately becomes invisible. In time some of the leaves
put forth branches. The plant being thus produced by humidity from
the seed is still soft and moist. Growing actively both above and
below, it cannot as yet bear fruit, for it has not the quality of
force and reserve (δύναμις ὶσχυρὴ καὶ πιαρἀ) from which a seed can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
precipitated. But when, with time, the plant becomes firmer and better
rooted, it develops veins as passages both upwards and downwards,
and it draws from the soil not only water but more abundantly also
substances that are denser and fatter. Warmed, too, by the sun, these
act as a ferment to the extremities and give rise to fruit after its
kind. The fruit thus develops much from little, for every plant draws
from the earth a power more abundant than that with which it started,
and the fermentation takes place not at one place but at
many.’<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Nor does our author hesitate to draw an analogy between the plant and
the mammalian embryo. ‘In the same way the infant lives within its
mother’s womb and in a state corresponding to the health of the mother
... and you will find a complete similitude between the products of the
soil and the products of the womb.’</p>

<p>The early Greek literature is so scantily provided with illustrations
drawn from botanical study, that it is worth considering the remarkable
comparison of generation of plants from cuttings with that from seeds
in the same work.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> ‘As regards plants generated from cuttings ...
that part of a branch where it was cut from a tree is placed in the
earth and there rootlets are sent out. This is how it happens: The part
of the plant within the soil draws up juices, swells, and develops a
<i>pneuma</i> (πνεῦμα ἴσχει), but not so the part without. The pneuma and
the juice concentrate the power of the plant below so that it becomes
denser. Then the lower end erupts and gives forth tender roots. Then
the plant, taking from below, draws juices from the roots and transmits
them to the part above the soil which thus also swells and develops
pneuma; thus the power from being diffused in the plant becomes
concentrated and budding, gives forth leaves.... Cuttings, then, differ
from seeds. With a seed the leaves are borne first, then the roots are
sent down; with a cutting the roots form first and then the
leaves.’<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>But with these works of the early part of the fourth century the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
stage of Greek biology reaches its finest development. Later
Hippocratic treatises which deal with physiological topics are on a
lower plane, and we must seek some external cause for the failure. Nor
have we far to seek. This period saw the rise of a movement that had
the most profound influence on every department of thought. We see
the advent into the Greek world of a great intellectual movement as a
result of which the department of philosophy that dealt with nature
receded before Ethics. Of that intellectual revolution—perhaps the
greatest the world has seen—Athens was the site and Socrates (470-399)
the protagonist. With the movement itself and its characteristic fruit
we are not concerned. But the great successor and pupil of its founder
gives us in the <i>Timaeus</i> a picture of the depth to which natural
science can be degraded in the effort to give a specific teleological
meaning to all parts of the visible Universe. The book and the picture
which it draws, dark and repulsive to the mind trained in modern
scientific method, enthralled the imagination of a large part of
mankind for wellnigh two thousand years. Organic nature appears in this
work of Plato (427-347) as the degeneration of man whom the Creator has
made most perfect. The school that held this view ultimately decayed as
a result of its failure to advance positive knowledge. As the centuries
went by its views became further and further divorced from phenomena,
and the bizarre developments of later Neoplatonism stand to this day as
a warning against any system which shall neglect the investigation of
nature. But in its decay Platonism dragged science down and destroyed
by neglect nearly all earlier biological material. Mathematics, not
being a phenomenal study, suited better the Neoplatonic mood and
continued to advance, carrying astronomy with it for a while—astronomy
that affected the life of man and that soon became the handmaid of
astrology; medicine, too, that determined the conditions of man’s life,
was also cherished, though often mistakenly, but pure science was doomed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>But though the ethical view of nature overwhelmed science in the end,
the advent of the mighty figure of Aristotle (384-322) stayed the tide
for a time. Yet the writer on Greek Biology remains at a disadvantage
in contrast with the Historian of Greek Mathematics, of Greek
Astronomy, or of Greek Medicine, in the scantiness of the materials
for presenting an account of the development of his studies before
Aristotle. The huge form of that magnificent naturalist completely
overshadows Greek as it does much of later Biology.</p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>Aristotle</i></h3>

<p>With Aristotle we come in sight of the first clearly defined
personality in the course of the development of Greek biological
thought—for the attribution of the authorship of the earlier
Hippocratic writings is more than doubtful, while the personality of
the great man by whose name they are called cannot be provided with
those clear outlines that historical treatment demands.</p>

<p>Aristotle was born in 384 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> at Stagira, a Greek
colony in the Chalcidice a few miles from the northern limit of the present
monastic settlement of Mount Athos. His father, Nicomachus, was
physician to Amyntas III of Macedonia and a member of the guild or
family of the Asclepiadae. From Nicomachus he may have inherited his
taste for biological investigation and acquired some of his methods.
At seventeen Aristotle became a pupil of Plato at Athens. After
Plato’s death in 347 Aristotle crossed the Aegean to reside at the
court of Hermias, despot of Atarneus in Mysia, whose niece, Pythias,
he married. It is not improbable that the first draft of Aristotle’s
biological works and the mass of his own observations were made during
his stay in this region, for in his biological writings much attention
is concentrated on the natural history of the Island of Lesbos, or
Mytilene, that lies close opposite to Atarneus. Investigation has
shown that in the <i>History of Animals</i> there are frequent references
to places on the northern and eastern littoral of the Aegean, and
especially to localities in the Island of Lesbos; on the other
hand places in Greece proper are but seldom mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Thus his biological investigations, in outline at least, are probably
the earliest of his extant works and preceded the philosophical
writings which almost certainly date from his second sojourn in Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
In 342 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, at the request of Philip of Macedon,
Aristotle became tutor to Philip’s son, Alexander. He remained in Macedonia
for seven years and about 336, when Alexander departed for the invasion of
Asia, returned to Athens where he taught at the Lyceum and established
his famous school afterwards called the Peripatetic. Most of his works
were produced during this the closing period of his life between 335
and 323 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> After Alexander’s death in 323 and
the break up of his empire, Aristotle, who was regarded as friendly to the
Macedonian power, was placed in a difficult position. Regarded with enmity
by the anti-Macedonian party, he withdrew from Athens and died soon after in
322 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> at Chalcis in Euboea at about sixty-two years of age.</p>

<p class="space-below2">The scientific works to which Aristotle’s name
is attached may be divided into three groups, physical, biological,
and psychological. In size they vary from such a large treatise as the
<i>History of Animals</i> to the tiny tracts which go to make up the <i>Parva
naturalia</i>. So far as the scientific writings can be distinguished as
separate works they may be set forth as follows:

Of these works some, the names of which are placed here in brackets,
are clearly spurious in that they were neither written by Aristotle nor
are they in any form approaching that in which they were cast by him.
Yet all are of very considerable antiquity and contain fragments of
his tradition in a state of greater or less corruption. In addition to
works here enumerated there are many others which are spurious in a yet
further sense in that they are merely fathered on Aristotle and contain
no trace of his spirit or method. Such, for example, is the famous mediaeval
work of oriental origin known as the <i>Epistle of Aristotle to Alexander</i>.</p>

<p>In a general way it may be stated that the <i>physical</i> works, with
which we are not here directly concerned, while they show ingenuity,
learning, and philosophical power, yet betray very little direct and
original observation. They have exerted enormous influence in the
past and for at least two thousand years provided the usual physical
conceptions of the civilized world both East and West. After the
Galilean revolution in physics, however, they became less regarded and
they are not now highly esteemed by men of science. The <i>biological</i>
works of Aristotle, on the other hand, excited comparatively little
interest during the Middle Ages, but from the sixteenth century on
they have been very closely studied by naturalists. From the beginning
of the nineteenth century, and especially as a result of the work of
Cuvier, Richard Owen, and Johannes Müller, Aristotle’s reputation as a
naturalist has risen steadily, and he is now universally admitted to
have been one of the very greatest investigators of living nature.</p>

<p>The philosophical bases of Aristotle’s biology are mainly to be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in the treatise <i>On soul</i> and in that <i>On the generation of animals</i>.
His actual observations are contained in this latter work—which is in
many ways his finest scientific production—in the great collection on
the <i>History of animals</i>, and in the remarkable treatise <i>On parts of
animals</i>. Certain of his deductions concerning the nature and mechanism
of life can be found in his two works which deal with the movements of
animals (one of which is very doubtfully genuine) and in his tracts
<i>On respiration</i>, <i>On sleep</i>, &amp;c. The treatise <i>On plants</i> and the
<i>Problems</i> in their present form are late and spurious, but they are
based on works of members of his school. They were, however, perhaps
originally prepared at the other end of the Greek world in Magna Graecia.</p>

<p>Aristotle was a most voluminous author and his biological writings
form but a small fraction of those to which his name is attached.
Yet these biological works contain a prodigious number of first-hand
observations and it has always been difficult to understand how one
investigator could collect all these facts, however rapid his work
and skilful his methods. The explanations that have reached us from
antiquity are, indeed, picturesque, but they are neither credible in
themselves nor are they consistent with each other. Thus Pliny writing
about <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 77 says ‘Alexander the Great,
fired by desire to learn of the natures of animals, entrusted the
prosecution of this design to Aristotle.... For this end he placed at
his disposal some thousands of men in every part of Asia and Greece,
and among them hunters, fowlers, fishers, park-keepers, herds-men,
bee-wards, as well as keepers of fish-ponds and aviaries in order that
no creature might escape his notice. Through the information thus
collected he was able to compose some fifty volumes.’<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Athenaeus, who lived in the early part of the third century <span
class="smcap">a. d.</span>, assures us that ‘Aristotle the Stagirite
received eight hundred talents [i.e. equal to about £200,000 of our money]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
from Alexander as his contribution towards perfecting his
<i>History of Animals</i>’.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Aelian, on the other hand, who lived at a period a little anterior to
Athenaeus, tells us that it was ‘Philip of Macedon who so esteemed
learning that he supplied Aristotle with ample funds’ adding that he
similarly honoured both Plato and Theophrastus.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Now in all Aristotle’s works there is not a single sentence in praise
of Alexander and there is some evidence that the two had become
estranged. In support of this we may quote Plutarch (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 100)
who gives a detailed description of a conspiracy in 327 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
against Alexander by Callisthenes, a pupil of Aristotle who appears to have kept up a correspondence
with his master.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Alexander himself wrote of Callisthenes, according to Plutarch: ‘I
will punish this sophist, together with those who sent him to me and
those who harbour in their cities men who conspire against my life’
and Plutarch adds that Alexander ‘directly reveals in these words
a hostility to Aristotle in whose house Callisthenes ... had been
reared, being a son of Hero who was a niece of Aristotle’.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Yet the Alexandrian conquests, bringing Greece into closer contact
with a wider world and extending Greek knowledge of the Orient, must
have had their influence in stimulating interest in rare and curious
creatures and in a general extension of natural knowledge. That the
interest in these topics extended beyond the circle of the Peripatetics
is shown by the fact that Speusippus, the pupil of Plato and his
successor as leader of his school, occupied himself with natural
history and wrote works on biological topics and especially on fish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, remarkable as is Aristotle’s acquaintance with animal
forms, investigation shows that he is reliable only when treating
of creatures native to the Aegean basin. As soon as he gets outside
that area his statements are almost always founded on hearsay or even
on fable.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Whatever assistance Aristotle may have received in the preparation of
his biological works came, therefore, probably from no such picturesque
and distant source as the gossip of Pliny or Aelian would suggest. We
can conjecture that he received aid from the powerful relatives of his
wife at Atarneus and in Lesbos, and we may most reasonably suppose
that after his return to Athens much help would have been given him by
his pupils within the Lyceum. To them may probably be ascribed many
passages in the biological writings; for it seems hardly possible
that Aristotle himself would have had time for detailed biological
research after he had settled as a teacher in Athens. Of the work
of these members of his school a fine monument has survived in two
complete botanical treatises and fragments of others on zoological
and psychological subjects by Theophrastus of Eresus, his pupil and
successor in the leadership of the Lyceum and perhaps his literary legatee.</p>

<p>When we turn to the Aristotelian biological works themselves we
naturally inquire first into the question of genuineness, and here
a difficulty arises in that all his extant works have come down to
us in a state that is not comparable to those of any other great
writer. Among the ancients admiration was expressed for Aristotle’s
eloquence and literary powers, but, in the material that we have here
to consider, very little trace of these qualities can be detected by
even the most lenient judge. The arrangement of the subject-matter is
far from perfect even if we allow for the gaps and disturbances caused
by their passage through many hands. Moreover, there is much repetition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and often irrelevant digression, while the language is usually plain
to baldness and very frequently obscure. We find sometimes the
lightening touch of humour, but the style hardly ever rises to beauty.
Furthermore, even in matters of fact, while many observations exhibit
wonderful insight and, forestalling modern discovery, betray a most
searching and careful application of scientific methods, yet elsewhere
we find errors that are childish and could have been avoided by the
merest tyro.</p>

<p>This curious state of the Aristotelian writings has given rise to much
discussion among scholars and to explain it there has been developed
what is known as the ‘notebook theory’. It is supposed that the
bases of the material that we possess were notebooks put together by
Aristotle himself for his own use, probably while lecturing. These
passed, it is believed, into the hands of certain of his pupils and
were perhaps in places incomprehensible as they stood. Such pupils,
after the master’s death, filled out the notebooks either from the
memory of his teaching or from their own knowledge—or ignorance. Thus
modified, however, they were still not prepared for publication, even
in the limited sense in which works may be said to have been published
in those days, but they formed again the fuller bases of notes for
lectures delivered by his successors. In this form they have finally
survived to our time, suffering, however, from certain further losses
and displacements on a larger scale. Some of the ‘Aristotelian’ works
are undoubtedly more deeply spurious, but the works that are regarded
as ‘genuine’ do not seem to have been seriously tampered with, except
by mere scribal or bookbinders’ blunders, at any date later than a
generation or two following Aristotle’s own time. These notebooks as
they stand are in fact probably in much the state in which we should
find them were we able to retrieve a copy dating from the first or
second century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
In the opening chapter of one of his great biological works Aristotle
sets forth in detail his motives for the study of living things. The
passage is in itself noteworthy as one of the few instances in which he
rises to real eloquence.</p>

<p>‘Of things constituted by nature some are ungenerated, imperishable,
and eternal, while others are subject to generation and decay. The
former are excellent beyond compare and divine, but less accessible
to knowledge. The evidence that might throw light on them, and on the
problems which we long to solve respecting them, is furnished but
scantily by sensation; whereas respecting perishable plants and animals
we have abundant information, living as we do in their midst, and ample
data may be collected concerning all their various kinds, if only we
are willing to take sufficient pains. Both departments, however, have
their special charm. The scanty conceptions to which we can attain of
celestial things give us, from their excellence, more pleasure than all
our knowledge of the world in which we live; just as a half glimpse
of persons we love is more delightful than a leisurely view of other
things, whatever their number and dimensions. On the other hand, in
certitude and in completeness our knowledge of terrestrial things has
the advantage. Moreover, their greater nearness and affinity to us
balances somewhat the loftier interest of the heavenly things that
are the objects of the higher philosophy.... For if some [creatures]
have no graces to charm the sense, yet even these, by disclosing to
intellectual perception the artistic spirit that designed them, give
immense pleasure to all who can trace links of causation, and are
inclined to philosophy. We therefore must not recoil with childish
aversion from the examination of the humbler animals. Every realm of
nature is marvellous. It is told of Heraclitus that when strangers
found him warming himself at the kitchen fire and hesitated to go in,
he bade them enter since even in the kitchen divinities were present.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
So should we venture on the study of every kind of animal without
distaste, for each and all will reveal to us something natural and
something beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Absence of haphazard and conduciveness of everything to an end are to
be found in Nature’s works in the highest degree, and the resultant end
of her generations and combinations is a form of the beautiful.</p>

<p>‘If any person thinks the examination of the rest of the animal kingdom
an unworthy task, he must hold in like disesteem the study of man. For
no one can look at the primordia of the human frame—blood, flesh,
bones, vessels, and the like—without much repugnance. Moreover, when
any one of the parts or structures, be it which it may, is under
discussion, it must not be supposed that it is its material composition
to which attention is being directed or which is the object of the
discussion, but the relation of such part to the total form....</p>

<p>‘As every instrument and every bodily member subserves some partial
end, that is to say, some special action, so the whole body must be
destined to minister to some plenary sphere of action. Thus the saw is
made for sawing, since sawing is a function, and not sawing for the
saw. Similarly, the body too must somehow or other be made for the
soul, and each part of it for some subordinate function to which it is
adapted.’<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle is, in the fullest sense a ‘vitalist’. He believes that the
presence of a certain peculiar principle of a non-material character
is essential for the exhibition of any of the phenomena of life. This
principle we may call <i>soul</i>, translating his word ψυχή. Living things,
like all else in nature, have, according to Aristotle, an end or
object. ‘Everything that Nature makes,’ he says, ‘is means to an end.
For just as human creations are the products of art, so living objects
are manifestly the products of an analogous cause or principle.... And
that the heaven, if it had an origin, was evolved and is maintained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
such a cause, there is, therefore, even more reason to believe, than
that mortal animals so originated. For order and definiteness are
much more manifest in the celestial bodies than in our own
frame.’<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
It was a misinterpretation of this view that especially endeared him
to the mediaeval Church and made it possible to absorb Aristotelian
philosophy into Christian theology. It must be remembered that the
cause or principle that leads to the development of living things is in
Aristotle’s view, not external but <i>internal</i>.</p>

<p>While putting his own view Aristotle does not fail to tell us of the
standpoint of his opponents. ‘Why, however, it must be asked, should
we look on the operations of Nature as dictated by a final cause, and
intended to realize some desirable end? Why may they not be merely the
results of necessity, just as the rain falls of necessity, and not
that the corn may grow? For though the rain makes the corn grow, it no
more occurs in order to cause that growth, than a shower which spoils
the farmer’s crop at harvest-time occurs in order to do that mischief.
Now, why may not this, which is true of the rain, be true also of the
parts of the body? Why, for instance, may not the teeth grow to be such
as they are merely of necessity, and the fitness of the front ones
with their sharp edge for the comminution of the food, and of the hind
ones with their flat surface for its mastication, be no more than an
accidental coincidence, and not the cause that has determined their
development?’<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The answers to these questions form a considerable part of Aristotle’s
philosophy where we are unable to follow him. For the limited field of
biology, however, the question is on somewhat narrower lines. ‘What,’
he asks, ‘are the forces by which the hand or the body was fashioned
into shape? The wood carver will perhaps say, by the axe or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
auger.... But it is not enough for him to say that by the stroke of his
tool this part was formed into a concavity, that into a flat surface;
but he must state the reasons why he struck his blow in such a way as
to effect this and what his final object was ... [similarly] the true
method [of biological science] is to state what the definite characters
are that distinguish the animal as a whole; to explain what it is both
in substance and in form, and to deal after the same fashion with its
several organs.... If now this something, that constitutes the form of
the living being, be the soul, or part of the soul, or something that,
without the soul, cannot exist, (as would seem to be the case, seeing
at any rate that when the soul departs, what is left is no longer a
living animal, and that none of the parts remain what they were before,
excepting in mere configuration, like the animals that in the fable
are turned into stone;) ... then it will come within the province of
the natural philosopher to inform himself concerning the soul, and to
treat of it, either in its entirety, or, at any rate, of that part of
it which constitutes the essential character of an animal; and it will
be his duty to say what this soul or this part of a soul is.’<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Thus in the Aristotelian writings the discussion of the nature and orders
of ‘soul’ is almost inseparable from the subjects now included under the
term Biology.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that through much of the Aristotelian writings
runs a belief in a <i>kinetic</i> as distinct from a static view of
existence. It cannot be claimed that he regarded the different kinds of
living things as actually passing one into another, but there can be no
doubt that he fully realized that the different kinds can be arranged
in a series in which the gradations are easy. His scheme would be
something like that represented on p. 30 (<a href="#FIG_07A">Fig. 7 a</a>).</p>

<p>‘Nature,’ he says, ‘proceeds little by little from things lifeless to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
animal life in such a way that it is impossible to determine the exact
line of demarcation, nor on which side thereof an intermediate form
should lie. Thus, next after lifeless things in the upward scale comes
the plant, and of plants one will differ from another as to its amount
of apparent vitality; and, in a word, the whole <i>genus</i> of plants,
whilst it is devoid of life as compared with an animal, is endowed
with life as compared with other corporeal entities. Indeed, there is
observed in plants a continuous scale of ascent towards the animal. So,
in the sea, there are certain objects concerning which one would be at
a loss to determine whether they be animal or vegetable.’<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>‘A sponge, in these respects completely resembles a plant, in that ...
it is attached to a rock, and that when separated from this it dies.
Slightly different from the sponges are the so-called Holothurias ...
as also sundry other sea-animals that resemble them. For these are free
and unattached, yet they have no feeling, and their life is simply that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of a plant separated from the ground. For even among land-plants there
are some that are independent of the soil—or even entirely free.
Such, for example, is the plant which is found on Parnassus, and which
some call the Epipetrum [probably <i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>, the common
houseleek]. This you may hang up on a peg and it will yet live for a
considerable time. Sometimes it is a matter of doubt whether a given
organism should be classed with plants or with animals. The Tethya,
for instance, and the like, so far resemble plants as that they never
live free and unattached, but, on the other hand, inasmuch as they have
a certain flesh-like substance, they must be supposed to possess some
degree of sensibility.’<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>‘The Acalephae or Sea-nettles, ... lie outside the recognized groups.
Their constitution, like that of the Tethya, approximates them on the
one side to plants, on the other side to animals. For seeing that some
of them can detach themselves and can fasten on their food, and that
they are sensible of objects which come in contact with them, they must
be considered to have an animal nature.... On the other hand, they
are closely allied to plants, firstly by the imperfection of their
structures, secondly by their being able to attach themselves to the
rocks, which they do with great rapidity, and lastly by their having no
visible residuum notwithstanding that they possess a mouth.’<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Thus ‘Nature passes from lifeless objects to animals in such unbroken
sequence, interposing between them beings which live and yet are not
animals, that scarcely any difference seems to exist between two
neighbouring groups owing to their close proximity.’<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Some approach to evolutionary doctrine is also foreshadowed by
Aristotle in his theories of the development of the individual. This is
obscured, however, by his peculiar view of the nature of procreation.
On this topic his general conclusion is that the material substance
of the embryo is contributed by the female, but that this is mere
passive formable material, almost as though it were the soil in which
the embryo grows. The male by giving the principle of life, the soul,
contributes the essential generative agency. But this <i>soul</i> is not
material and it is, therefore, not theoretically necessary for anything
material to pass from male to female. The material which does in fact
so pass with the seed of the male is an accident, not an essential, for
the essential contribution of the male is not matter but <i>form</i> and
<i>principle</i>. The female provides the <i>material</i>, the male the <i>soul</i>,
the <i>form</i>, the <i>principle</i>, that which makes life. Aristotle was thus
prepared to accept instances of fertilization without material contact.</p>

<p>‘The female does not contribute semen to generation but does contribute
something ... for there must needs be that which generates and that
from which it generates.... If, then, the male stands for the effective
and active, and the female, considered as female, for the passive, it
follows that what the female would contribute to the semen of the male
would not be semen but material for the semen to work upon....</p>

<p>‘How is it that the male contributes to generation, and how is it
that the semen from the male is the cause of the offspring? Does [the
semen] exist in the body of the embryo as a part of it from the first,
mingling with the material which comes from the female? Or does the
semen contribute nothing to the material body of the embryo but only to
the power and movement in it?... The latter alternative appears to be
the right one both <i>a priori</i> and in view of the facts.’<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This discussion leads to the question of the natural process of
generation itself. It is a topic that we have seen discussed by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
earlier writer who had set forth a sort of doctrine of pangenesis
(<a href="#Page_14">see p. 14</a>). His view Aristotle declines to share. ‘We must’,
he says, ‘say the opposite of what the ancients said. For whereas they said that
semen is that which <i>comes from all</i> the body, we shall say that it
is that whose nature is to <i>go to all</i> of it, and what they thought a
waste-product seems rather to be a secretion.’ According to Aristotle
semen is derived from the same nutritive material in the blood vessels
that is distributed to the rest of the body. The semen, however, is
strained or secreted off from this nutritive material—as being its
most essential and representative portion—before the distribution
actually takes place.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
But why, it may be asked, if the semen does not come from the various
parts of the body, is it yet able to reproduce those various parts?
The answer, on the Aristotelian view, seems to be that the semen
contains special and peculiar fractions of the nutritive fluid which
have been so modified and adapted that, if not secreted off as semen,
they would be distributed to the different parts of the body to nourish
each of these various parts. These substances have been elaborated by
the <i>soul</i> or vital principle in a manner that is specifically suited
for each organ, hand, liver, face, heart, &amp;c., and from each of
these specific substances a specific essence is separated off into the
semen corresponding to hand, liver, face, heart, &amp;c., of the offspring.</p>

<p>The next question that arises is the mechanism by which the offspring
come to resemble their parents. The mechanism in the case of
inheritance from the father is comprehensible when we consider the
origin and nature of the semen, but the inheritance from the mother
requires further explanation. The view of Aristotle is based upon the
nature of the catamenia and their disappearance during gestation. ‘The
catamenia’, in his view, ‘are a secretion as the semen is.’<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The female contributes the material by which the embryo grows and she does
this through the catamenia which are suspended during gestation for
this very purpose. The matter is thus summed up by Aristotle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
‘The male does not emit semen at all in some animals, and where he
does, this is no part of the resulting embryo; just so no material part
comes from the carpenter to the material, i.e. to the wood in which he
works, nor does any part of the carpenter’s art exist within what he
makes, but the shape and the form are imparted from him to the material
by means of the motion he sets up. It is his hands that move his tools,
his tools that move the material; it is his knowledge of his art, and
his <i>soul</i>, in which is the form, that move his hands or any other
part of him with a motion of some definite kind, a motion varying with
the varying nature of the object made. In like manner, in the male of
those animals which emit semen, Nature uses the semen as a tool and as
possessing motion in actuality, just as tools are used in the products
of any art, for in them lies in a certain sense the motion of the
art.’<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>‘For the same reason the development of the embryo takes place in the
female; neither the male himself nor the female emits semen into the
female, but the female receives within herself the share contributed
by both, because in the female is the material from which is made
the resulting product. Not only must the mass of material from which
the embryo is in the first instance formed exist there, but further
material must constantly be added so that the embryo may increase
in size. Therefore the birth must take place in the female. For the
carpenter must keep in close connexion with his timber and the potter
with his clay, and generally all workmanship and the ultimate movement
imparted to matter must be connected with the material concerned, as,
for instance, architecture is <i>in</i> the buildings it makes.’<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The problem of the nature of generation is one in which Aristotle never
ceased to take an interest, and among the methods by which he sought to
solve it was embryological investigation. In his ideas on the methods
of reproduction we must seek also the main bases of such classification
of animals as he exhibits. His most important embryological researches
were made upon the chick. He asserts that the first signs of
development are noticeable on the third day, the heart being visible
as a palpitating blood-spot whence, as it develops, two meandering
blood vessels extend to the surrounding tunics.</p>

<p>‘Generation from the egg’, he says, ‘proceeds in an identical manner
with all birds.... With the common hen after three days and nights
there is the first indication of the embryo.... The heart appears like
a speck of blood in the white of the egg. This point beats and moves as
though endowed with life, and from it two vessels with blood in them
trend in a convoluted course ... and a membrane carrying bloody fibres
now envelops the yolk, leading off from the vessels.’<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle lays considerable stress on the early appearance of the heart
in the embryo. Corresponding to the general gradational view that he
had formed of Nature, he held that the most primitive and fundamentally
important organs make their appearance before the others. Among the
organs all give place to the heart, which he considered ‘the first to
live and the last to die’.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A little later he observed that the body had become distinguishable,
and was at first very small and white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
‘The head is clearly distinguished and in it the eyes, swollen out to
a great extent.... At the outset the under portion of the body appears
insignificant in comparison with the upper portion....</p>

<p>‘When an egg is ten days old the chick and all its parts are distinctly
visible. The head still is larger than the rest of the body and the
eyes larger than the head. At this time also the larger internal
organs are visible, as also the stomach and the arrangement of the
viscera; and the vessels that seem to proceed from the heart are now
close to the navel. From the navel there stretch a pair of vessels,
one [vitelline vein] towards the membrane that envelops the yolk,
and the other [allantoic vein] towards that membrane which envelops
collectively the membrane wherein the chick lies, the membrane of the
yolk and the intervening liquid.... About the twentieth day, if you
open the egg and touch the chick, it moves inside and chirps; and it is
already coming to be covered with down when, after the twentieth day,
the chick begins to break the shell.’<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle recognized a distinction in the mode of development of
mammals from that of all other viviparous creatures. Having divided the
apparently viviparous animals into two groups, one of which is truly
and internally and the other only externally viviparous, he pointed
out that in the mammalia, the group regarded by him as internally
viviparous, the foetus is connected until birth with the wall of
the mother’s womb by the navel-string. These animals, in his view,
produce their young without the intervention of an ovum, the embryo
being ‘living from the first’. Such non-mammals, on the other hand, as
are viviparous are so in the external sense only, that is, the young
which he considered to arise in this group from ova may indeed develop
within the mother’s womb and be born alive, but they go through their
development without organic connexion with the mother’s body, so that
her womb acts but as a nursery or incubator for her eggs. It was indeed
a sort of accident among the ovipara whether in any particular species
the ovum went through its development inside or outside the mother’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
body. ‘Some of the ovipara’, he says, ‘produce the egg in a perfect,
others in an imperfect state, but it is perfected outside the body as
has been stated of fish.’<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Yet though Aristotle regarded fish as an oviparous group, he knew
also of kinds of fish that were externally viviparous. It is most
interesting to observe, moreover, that he was acquainted with one
particular instance among fish in which matters were less simple and
in which the development bore an analogy to that of the mammalia, his
true internal vivipara. ‘Some animals’, he says, ‘are viviparous,
others oviparous, others vermiparous. Some are viviparous, such as man,
the horse, the seal and all other animals that are hair-coated, and,
of marine animals, the Cetaceans, as the dolphin, <i>and the so-called
Selachia</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle tells us elsewhere that a species of these Selachia which
he calls <i>galeos</i>—a name still used for the dog-fish by Greek
fishermen—‘has its eggs in betwixt the [two horns of the] womb; these
eggs shift into each of the two horns of the womb and descend, and the
young develop with the navel-string attached to the womb, so that,
as the egg-substance gets used up, the embryo is sustained to all
appearances just as in quadrupeds. The navel-string is ... attached
as it were by a sucker, and also to the centre of the embryo in the
place where the liver is situated.... Each embryo, as in the case of
quadrupeds, is provided with a chorion and separate membranes.’<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The remarkable anatomical relationship of the embryo of <i>Galeus</i>
(<i>Mustelus</i>) <i>laevis</i> to its mother’s womb was little noticed by
naturalists until the whole matter was taken up by Johannes Müller
about 1840.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
That great observer demonstrated the complete accuracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of Aristotle’s description and the justice of his comparison to and
contrast with the mammalian mode of development.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The work of Johannes Müller at once had the effect of drawing
the attention of naturalists to the importance and value of the
Aristotelian biological observations.</p>

<p>Aristotle attempts to explain the viviparous character of the
Selachians. His explanation has perhaps little meaning for the modern
biologist, just as many of our scientific explanations will seem
meaningless to our successors. But such explanations are often worth
consideration not only as stages in the historical development of
scientific thought, but also as illustrating the fact that while the
ultimate object of science is a <i>description</i> of nature, the immediate
motive of the best scientific work is usually an <i>explanation</i> of
nature. Yet it is usually the descriptive, not the explanatory element
that bears the test of time.</p>

<p>‘Birds and scaly reptiles’, says Aristotle, ‘because of their heat
produce a perfect egg, but because of their dryness it is only an
egg. The cartilaginous fishes have less heat than these but more
moisture, so that they are intermediate, for they are both oviparous
and viviparous within themselves, the former because they are cold, the
latter because of their moisture; for moisture is vivifying, whereas
dryness is farthest removed from what has life. Since they have neither
feathers nor scales such as either reptiles or other fishes have, all
of which are signs rather of a dry and earthy nature, the egg they
produce is soft; for the earthy matter does not come to the surface in
their eggs any more than in themselves. That is why they lay eggs in
themselves, for if the egg were laid externally it would be destroyed,
having no protection.’<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>This explanation is based on Aristotle’s fundamental doctrine of the
opposite <i>qualities</i>, heat, cold, wetness, and dryness, that are
found combined in pairs in the four <i>elements</i>, earth, air, fire,
and water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The theory was of the utmost importance for the whole subsequent
development of science and was not displaced until quite modern
times. It was not an original conception of Aristotle, for something
resembling it had been set forth long before his time in figurative
language by Empedocles (<i>c.</i> 500-<i>c.</i> 430 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>),
as Aristotle himself tells us.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The same view had been foreshadowed by Pythagoras (<i>c.</i> 580-<i>c.</i> 490
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) at an even earlier date and was
perhaps of much greater antiquity. But Aristotle developed the doctrine
and was the main channel for its conveyance to later ages, so that
his name will always be associated with it. Matter in general and
living matter in particular was held by him to be composed of these
four essential so-called <i>elements</i> (στοιχεῑ), each of which is in
turn compounded from two of the primary <i>qualities</i> (δυνάμεις) which
Aristotle brought into relation with the elements. Thus earth was cold
and dry, water cold and wet, air hot and wet, and fire hot and dry (<a href="#FIG_07B">Fig. 7b</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="FIG_07B" name="FIG_07B">&nbsp;</a>

    <p class="center space-below2">Fig. 7b. The Four Elements and the Four Qualities.</p>
</div>

<p>The theory of the elements and qualities is applicable to all matter
and not specially to living things. The distinction between the
living and not-living is to be sought not so much in its material
constitution, but in the presence or absence of ‘soul’, and his
teaching on that topic is to be found in his great work περὶ ψυχῆς,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>On Soul</i>. He does not think of matter as organic or inorganic—that
is a distinction of the seventeenth century physiologists—nor does he think
of things as divided into animal, vegetable, and mineral—that is a
distinction of the mediaeval alchemists,—but he thinks of things as
either with soul or without soul (ἔμψυχα or ἄαψυχα).</p>

<p>His belief as to the relationship of this soul to material things is a
difficult and complicated subject which would take us far beyond the
topics included in biological writings to-day, but he tells us that
‘there is a class of existent things which we call substance, including
under that term, firstly, matter, which in itself is not this nor that;
secondly, shape or form, in virtue of which the term this or that is
at once applied; thirdly, the whole made up of matter and form. Matter
is identical with potentiality, form with actuality,’ the soul being,
in living things, that which gives the form or actuality. ‘Of natural
bodies’, he continues, ‘some possess life and some do not: where by
life we mean the power of self-nourishment and of independent growth
and decay’.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
It should here be noted that in the Aristotelian sense the ovum is
not at first a living thing, for in its earliest stage and before
fertilization it does not possess soul even in its most elementary form.</p>

<p>‘The term life is used in various senses, and, if life is present in
but a single one of these senses, we speak of a thing as living. Thus
there is intellect, sensation, motion from place to place and rest, the
motion concerned with nutrition, and, further, [there are the processes
of] decay and growth,’ all various meanings or at least exhibitions
of some form of life. Hence even ‘plants are supposed to have life,
for they have within themselves a faculty and principle whereby they
grow and decay.... They grow and continue to live so long as they are
capable of absorbing nutriment. This form of life can be separated from
the others ... and plants have no other faculty of soul at all,’ but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
only this lowest vegetative soul. ‘It is then in virtue of this
principle that all living things live, whether animals or plants. But
it is sensation which primarily constitutes the animal. For, provided
they have sensation, even those creatures that are devoid of movement
and do not change their place are called animals.... As the nutritive
faculty may exist without touch or any form of sensation, so also touch
may exist apart from other senses.’<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Apart from these two lower forms of soul, the <i>vegetative</i> or nutritive
and reproductive and the <i>animal</i> or sensitive, stands the <i>rational</i>
or intellectual soul peculiar to man, a form of soul with which we
shall here hardly concern ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The possession of one or more of the three types of soul, vegetative,
sensitive, and rational, provides in itself a basis for an elementary
form of arrangement of living things in an ascending scale. We
have already seen that Aristotle certainly describes something
resembling a ‘Scala Naturae’ and that such a scheme can easily be
drawn up from passages in his works. It may, however, be doubted
whether his phraseology is capable of extension so as to include a
true <i>classification</i> of animals in any modern sense. It is true
that he repeatedly divides animals into classes, <i>Sanguineous</i> and
<i>Non-sanguineous</i>, <i>Oviparous</i> and <i>Viviparous</i>, <i>Terrestrial</i>
and <i>Aquatic</i>, &amp;c., but his divisions are for the most part simply
dichotomic. He certainly defines a few groups of animals as the Lophura
(<i>Equidae</i>), the Cete (<i>Cetacea</i>), and the Selache (<i>Elasmobranchiae</i>
together with the <i>Lophiidae</i>) in a way that fairly corresponds
to similar groups in later systems. In most cases, however, his
definitions are not exact enough for modern needs, for the same animal
may fall into more than one of his classes and widely different animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
into the same class. Thus he invents a category <i>Carcharodonta</i> for
animals with sharp interlocking teeth and includes in it carnivores,
reptiles, and fish; again, the horse kind must be included both among
his <i>Anepallacta</i> or animals having flat crowned teeth as well as among
the <i>Amphodonta</i> or animals with front teeth in both jaws. Such words
as these are really terms of <i>description</i>, not of classification in
the modern biological sense of that word.</p>

<p>There are, however, scattered through the biological works, certain
terms which are applied to animal groups and organs and are defined in
such a way as to suggest that they might ultimately have been developed
for classificatory purposes. Thus his lowest group is the <i>species</i>.
‘The individuals comprised within a single <i>species</i> (εîδος) ... are
the real existences; but inasmuch as these individuals possess one
common specific form, it will suffice to state the universal attributes
of the species, that is, the attributes common to all its individuals,
once and for all.’<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This is surely not very far removed from the
modern biological conception of a species.</p>

<p>‘But as regards the larger groups—such as birds—which comprehend many
species, there may be a question. For on the one hand it may be urged
that as the ultimate species represent the real existences, it will be
well, if practicable, to examine these ultimate species separately,
just as we examine the species Man separately; to examine, that is, not
the whole class Birds collectively, but the Ostrich, the Crane, and the
other indivisible groups or species belonging to the class.</p>

<p>‘On the other hand, this course would involve repeated mention of the
same attribute, as the same attribute is common to many species, and so
far would be somewhat irrational and tedious. Perhaps, then, it will be
best to treat generically the universal attributes of the groups that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
have a common nature and contain closely allied subordinate forms,
whether they are groups recognized by a true instinct of mankind,
such as Birds and Fishes, or groups not popularly known by a common
appellation, but withal composed of closely allied subordinate groups;
and only to deal individually with the attributes of a single species,
when such species—man, for instance, and any other such, if such there
be—stands apart from others, and does not constitute with them a
larger natural group.</p>

<p>‘It is generally similarity in the shape of particular organs, or of
the whole body, that has determined the formation of the larger groups.
It is in virtue of such a similarity that Birds, Fishes, Cephalopoda,
and Testacea have been made to form each a separate <i>genus</i> (γένος).
For within the limits of each such <i>genus</i>, the parts do not differ
in that they have no nearer resemblance than that of analogy—such as
exists between the bone of man and the spine of fish—but they differ
merely in respect of such corporeal conditions as largeness smallness,
softness hardness, smoothness roughness, and other similar oppositions,
or, in one word, in respect of degree.’<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The Aristotelian <i>genus</i> thus differs widely from the term as used in
modern biology. In another passage he comes nearer to defining it and
the analogy of parts which extends from genus to genus.</p>

<p>‘Groups that differ only in the degree, and in the more or less of
an identical element that they possess are aggregated together under
a single <i>genus</i>; groups whose attributes are not identical but
<i>analogous</i> are separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by
gradation, or by excess and defect; some birds have long feathers,
others short ones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote
and only agree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
feather, in the fish is scale. Such <i>analogies</i> can scarcely, however,
serve universally as indications for the formation of groups, for
almost all animals present analogies in their corresponding parts.’<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle nowhere gives to his term <i>genus</i> a rigid application that
can be applied throughout the animal kingdom. He uses the word in fact
much as we should use the conveniently flexible term <i>group</i>, now
for a larger and less definite, now for a smaller and more definite
collection of species. This varying use of a technical word makes it
impossible to draw up a classification based on his <i>genera</i> or indeed
with any consistent use of the terms which he actually employs.</p>

<p class="space-below2">The difficulty or impossibility of drawing up a satisfactory
classificatory system from the Aristotelian writings has not, however,
deterred numerous naturalists and scholars from making the attempt,
and the subject has in itself a considerable history and literature<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
extending from the days of Edward Wotton (1492-1555) downward.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The more recent efforts at drawing up an Aristotelian classificatory system
have been based on the methods of reproduction to which he certainly
attached very great importance.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Provided that it be remembered that Aristotle does not himself detail
any such system there can be no harm in constructing one from his
works. At worst it will serve as a <i>memoria technica</i> for the extent
and character of his knowledge of natural history, and at best it may
represent a scheme to which he was tending.

<p class="space-above2">Some of the elements in this classification are fundamentally
unsatisfactory in that they are based on negative characters. Such
is the group of <i>Anaima</i> which is parallelled by our own equally
convenient and negative though morphologically meaningless equivalent
<i>Invertebrata</i>. Others, such as the subdivisions of the viviparous
quadrupeds, can only be forcibly extracted out of Aristotle’s text.
But there are yet others, such as the separation of the cartilaginous
from the bony fishes, that exhibit true genius and betray a knowledge
that can only have been reached by careful investigation. Remarkably
brilliant too is his treatment of Molluscs. There can be no doubt that
he dissected the bodies and carefully watched the habits of octopuses
and squids, <i>Malacia</i> as he calls them. He separates them too far from
the other Molluscs, grouped by him as <i>Ostracoderma</i>, but his actual
descriptions of the structure and sexual process of the cephalopods
are exceedingly remarkable, and after being long disregarded or
misunderstood were verified and repeated in the course of the
nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Passing from his general ideas on the nature and division of living
creatures we may turn to some of the most noteworthy of his actual
observations. In the realm of comparative anatomy proper we may
instance that of the stomach of ruminants. He must have dissected these
animals, for he gives a clear and correct account of the four chambers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
‘Animals’, he says, ‘present diversities in the structure of their
stomachs. Of the viviparous quadrupeds, such of the horned animals as
are not equally furnished with teeth in both jaws are furnished with
four such chambers. These animals are those that are said to chew the
cud. In these animals the oesophagus extends from the mouth downwards
along the lung, from the midriff to the <i>big stomach</i> [<i>rumen</i>, or
paunch], and this stomach is rough inside and semi-partitional. And
connected with it near to the entry of the oesophagus is what is
called the <i>kekryphalos</i> [<i>reticulum</i>, or honeycomb bag]; for outside
it is like the stomach, but inside it resembles a netted cap; and the
kekryphalos is a good deal smaller than the <i>big stomach</i>.’ The term
<i>kekryphalos</i> was applied to the net that women wore over their hair
to keep it in order. ‘Connected with this kekryphalos,’ he continues,
‘is the <i>echinos</i> [<i>psalterium</i>, or <i>manyplies</i>], rough inside and
laminated, and of about the same size as the kekryphalos. Next after
this comes what is called the <i>enystron</i> [<i>abomasum</i>], larger and
longer than the echinos, furnished inside with numerous folds or
ridges, large and smooth. After all this comes the gut....’<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
‘All animals that have horns, the sheep for instance, the ox, the goat, the
deer and the like, have these several stomachs.... The several cavities
receive the food one from the other in succession: the first taking the
unreduced substances, the second the same when somewhat reduced, the
third when reduction is complete, and the fourth when the whole has
become a smooth pulp....’<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
‘Such is the stomach of those quadrupeds that are horned and have an
unsymmetrical dentition (μὴ ἀμφώδοντα); and these animals differ one
from another in the shape and size of the parts, and in the fact of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
oesophagus reaching the stomach central-wise in some cases and sideways
in others. Animals that are furnished equally with teeth in both jaws
(ἀμφώδοντα) have one stomach; as man, the pig, the dog, the bear, the
lion, the wolf.’<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>A very famous example in the Aristotelian works anticipating modern
biological knowledge is afforded by his reference to the mode of
reproduction of the cephalopods. ‘The Malacia such as the octopus,
the sepia, and the calamary, have sexual intercourse all in the same
way; that is to say, they unite at the mouth by an interlacing of
their tentacles. When, then, the octopus rests its so-called head
against the ground and spreads abroad its tentacles, the other sex
fits into the outspreading of these tentacles, and the two sexes then
bring their suckers into mutual connexion. Some assert that the male
has a kind of penis in one of his tentacles, the one in which are the
largest suckers; and they further assert that the organ is tendinous
in character growing attached right up to the middle of the tentacle,
and that the latter enables it to enter the nostril or funnel of the
female.’<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The reproductive processes of the Cephalopods were unknown to modern
naturalists until the middle of the nineteenth century. Before that
time several observers had noted the occasional presence of a peculiar
parasite in the mantle cavity of female cephalopods and had described
its supposed structure without tracing any relationship to the process
of generation. In 1851 it was first shown that this supposed parasite
was the arm of the male animal specially modified for reproductive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
purposes and broken off on insertion into the mantle cavity of the
female<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.
The actual process of reproduction does not seem to have been observed
until 1894<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>Aristotle is perhaps at his best and happiest when describing the
habits of living animals that he has himself observed. Among his most
pleasing accounts are those of the fishing-frog and torpedo. In these
creatures he did not fail to notice the displacement of the fins
associated with the depressed form of the body.</p>

<p>‘In marine creatures,’ he says, ‘one may observe many ingenious devices
adapted to the circumstances of their lives. For the account commonly
given of the frog-fish or angler is quite true; as is also that of the
torpedo....</p>

<p>‘In the Torpedo and the Fishing-frog the breadth of the anterior part
of the body is not so great as to render locomotion by fins impossible,
but in consequence of it the upper pair [<i>pectorals</i>] are placed
further back and the under pair [<i>ventrals</i>] are placed close to the
head, while to compensate for this advancement they are reduced in size
so as to be smaller than the upper ones.</p>

<p>‘In the Torpedo the two upper fins [pectorals] are placed in the tail,
and the fish uses the broad expansion of its body to supply their
place, each lateral half of its circumference serving the office of a
fin.... The torpedo narcotizes the creatures that it wants to catch,
overpowering them by the force of shock that is resident in its body,
and feeds upon them; it also hides in the sand and mud, and catches
all the creatures that swim in its way and come under its narcotizing
influence. This phenomenon has been actually observed in operation....
The torpedo-fish is known to cause a numbness even in human beings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The frog-fish has a set of filaments that project in front of its
eyes; they are long and thin, like hairs, and are round at the tips;
they lie on either side, and are used as baits.... The little creatures
on which this fish feeds swim up to the filaments, taking them for bits
of seaweed such as they feed upon. Accordingly, when the frog-fish
stirs himself up a place where there is plenty of sand and mud and
conceals himself therein, it raises the filaments, and when the little
fish strike against them the frog-fish draws them in underneath into
its mouth.... That the creatures get their living by this means is
obvious from the fact that, whereas they are peculiarly inactive,
they are often caught with mullets, the swiftest of fishes, in their
interior. Furthermore, the frog-fish is usually thin when he is caught
after losing the tips of his filaments.’<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The modification of the musculature of the torpedo-fish for electric
purposes and the fishing habits of the fishing-frog or <i>Lophius</i> are
now well known, but it was many centuries before naturalists had
confirmed the observations of the father of biology.</p>

<p>When we turn from Aristotle’s observations in the department of natural
history to his discussion of the actual mechanism of the living body,
the subject now contained under the heading <i>Experimental Physiology</i>,
we are in the presence of much less satisfactory material. Aristotle
here exhibits his weakness in physics and not being endowed with any
experimental knowledge of that subject his physiological development is
very greatly handicapped. He seems often to accept fancies of his own
in place of generalizations from collated observations. This tendency
of his was conveyed to his successors and delayed physiological advance
for many centuries. It forms a striking contrast to the method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
certain of the Hippocratic works such as the <i>Epidemics</i> and the
<i>Aphorisms</i> which exhibit an investigator intent on recording
actual observations and on deducing general laws therefrom. Had the
Hippocratic method been extended by Aristotle beyond the field of
natural history, where he freely follows it, to that of physiology, the
succeeding generations might have established medicine far more firmly
as a science.</p>

<p>An important factor in Aristotle’s physical and physiological
teaching is the doctrine that matter is continuous and not made
up of indivisible parts. He thus rejected the atomic views of his
predecessors Leucippus and Democritus which have been preserved for us
by the poem of Lucretius. The different kinds of matter existing merely
in their state of simple mixture formed various uniform or homogeneous
substances, <i>homoeomeria</i>, of which the <i>tissues</i> of living bodies
provided one type. We now consider tissues as having structure made up
of living cells or their products, but to Aristotle their structure was
an essential fact following on their particular elemental constitution.
The structure of muscle or flesh was perhaps comparable to that of
a crystalline substance, for, as we have seen, Aristotle made no
fundamental distinction between organic and inorganic <i>substances</i>,
which are in his view alike subject to the processes of generation and
corruption. The difference between them lies not in their structure
but in their potential relation to the various degrees of soul, the
vegetative, the animal, and the rational.</p>

<p>‘There are’, says Aristotle, ‘three degrees of composition, and of
these the first in order is composition out of what some call the
<i>elements</i>, earth, air, water, and fire....</p>

<p>‘The second degree of composition is that by which the <i>homogeneous</i>
parts of animals (ὁμοιομερῆ), such as bone, flesh, and the like, are
constituted out of [these] primary substances.</p>

<p>‘The third and last stage is the composition which forms the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<i>heterogeneous</i> parts (ἀνομοιομερῆ) such as face, hand, and the
rest.’<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The distinctions are not altogether clear but may perhaps be explained
along such lines as the following. The division into homogeneous and
heterogeneous corresponds in a general way to the later division
into Tissues and Organs, the former, however, including much that we
should not call tissue. The homogeneous parts were again of two kinds:
(<i>a</i>) simple tissues or stuffs without any notion of size or shape,
that is, mere substance capable of endowment with life or soul, e.g.
cartilaginous or osseous tissues; and (<i>b</i>) simple structure, that is
actual structure made of such a single tissue but with definite form
and size, matter to which form had been added and which either was
actually or had been endowed with soul, e.g. <i>a</i> cartilage or <i>a</i> bone.</p>

<p>As a physiologist Aristotle is, in fact, in much the same position as
he is as a physicist. He never dissected the human body, he had only
the roughest idea of the course of the vessels, and his description of
the vascular system is so difficult and confused that a considerable
literature has been written on its interpretation. He regarded the
heart as the central organ of the body and the seat of sensation and he
probably believed that the arteries contained air as well as blood. He
made no adequate distinction between veins and arteries. He tells us
that two great vessels arise from the heart and that the heart is, as
it were, a part of these vessels. The two vessels are apparently the
aorta and the vena cava, and a very elementary and not very accurate
description is given of the branches of these vessels. He believed that
the heart had three chambers or cavities and that it took in air direct
from the lung.</p>

<p>The brain was for him mainly an organ by which were secreted certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cold humours which prevented any overheating of the body by the furnace
of the heart under the action of the bellows of the lung. He formally
rejected the older views of Diogenes of Apollonia, of Alcmaeon of
Croton, and of the Hippocratic writings, that placed the seat of
sensation in the brain.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
He failed to trace any adequate relation of sense organs and nerves
to brain. He considered that the spinal marrow served to hold the
vertebrae together.</p>

<p>In general we may say that his physiology is on a much lower plane than
his natural history, since in dealing with physiological questions he
always seems to have in mind the body as a whole and seldom pauses for
any detailed investigation of a particular part. The physiological
views of Aristotle were far from being fully accepted even by the
generation which followed him. There was already growing up a school
of physiologists whose work culminated five centuries later in that of
Galen, where we find quite other views of the bodily functions. It is
these views which we may take as more typical of the bases of Greek
physiology (<a href="#Page_66">see p. 66</a>).</p>

<p>In much of the Aristotelian material that we have discussed we have
seen the development of a class of interests very foreign to those
of the modern biologist, in whose work the general discussion of the
ultimate nature and origin of life seldom plays a large part. The
business of the modern biologist is mainly with vital phenomena as he
encounters them and he is not concerned with the deeper philosophical
problems. The man of science considers a part of the Universe where the
philosopher makes it his business to regard the whole. With Aristotle
this modern scientific process of taking a part of the sensible
Universe, such as a particular group of animals or the particular
action of a particular organ, and considering it in and by and for
itself without reference to other things, had not yet fully emerged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Philosophy and science are still inextricably linked and there is no
clear demarcation between them.</p>

<p>This is at least his theoretical view. But besides being a philosopher
by choice he was a supreme naturalist by his natural endowments and he
cannot suppress his love for nature and his capacity for observation.
We see Aristotle the naturalist at his greatest as a direct observer
or when reasoning directly about the observations that he has made.
When he disregards his own observations and begins to erect theories
on the observations or the views of others, he becomes weaker and less
comprehensible.</p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>After Aristotle</i></h3>

<p>All Aristotle’s surviving biological works refer primarily to the
animal creation. His work on plants is lost or rather has survived
as the merest corrupted fragment. We are fortunate, however, in the
possession of a couple of complete works by his pupil and successor
Theophrastus (372-287), which may not only be taken to represent the
Aristotelian attitude towards the plant world, but also give us an
inkling of the general state of biological science in the generation
which succeeded the master.</p>

<p>These treatises of Theophrastus are in many respects the most complete
and orderly of all ancient biological works that have reached our time.
They give an idea of the kind of interest that the working scientist
of that day could develop when inspired rather by the genius of a
great teacher than by the power of his own thoughts. Theophrastus
is a pedestrian where Aristotle is a creature of wings, he is in a
relation to the master of the same order that the morphologists of the
second half of the nineteenth century were to Darwin. For a couple of
generations after the appearance of the <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859 the
industry and ability of naturalists all over the world were occupied in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
working out in detail the structure and mode of life of living
things on the basis of the Evolutionary philosophy. Nearly all the
work on morphology and much of that on physiology since his time
might be treated as a commentary on the works of Darwin. These
volumes of Theophrastus give the same impression. They represent the
remains—alas, almost the only biological remains—of a school working
under the impulse of a great idea and spurred by the memory of a great
teacher. As such they afford a parallel to much scientific work of our
own day, produced by men without genius save that provided by a vision
and a hope and an ideal. Of such men it is impossible to write as of
Aristotle. Their lives are summed up by their actual achievement, and
since Theophrastus is an orderly writer whose works have descended to
us in good state, he is a very suitable instance of the actual standard
of achievement of ancient biology. ‘Without vision the people perish’
and the very breath of life of science is drawn, and can only be drawn,
from that very small band of prophets who from time to time, during the
ages, have provided the great generalizations and the great ideals. In
this light let us examine the work of Theophrastus.</p>

<p>In the absence of any adequate system of classification, almost all
botany until the seventeenth century consisted mainly of descriptions
of species. To describe accurately a leaf or a root in the language
in ordinary use would often take pages. Modern botanists have
invented an elaborate terminology which, however hideous to eye and
ear, has the crowning merit of helping to abbreviate scientific
literature. Botanical writers previous to the seventeenth century were
substantially without this special mode of expression. It is partly to
this lack that we owe the persistent attempts throughout the centuries
to represent plants pictorially in herbals, manuscript and printed, and
thus the possibility of an adequate history of plant illustration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Theophrastus seems to have felt acutely the need of botanical terms,
and there are cases in which he seeks to give a special technical
meaning to words in more or less current use. Among such words are
<i>carpos</i> = fruit, <i>pericarpion</i> = seed vessel = pericarp, and <i>metra</i>,
the word used by him for the central core of any stem whether formed of
wood, pith, or other substance. It is from the usage of Theophrastus
that the exact definition of fruit and pericarp has come down to
us.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
We may easily discern also the purpose for which he introduces into
botany the term <i>metra</i>, a word meaning primarily the <i>womb</i>, and the
vacancy in the Greek language which it was made to fill. ‘<i>Metra</i>,’ he
says, ‘is that which is in the middle of the wood, being third in order
from the bark and [thus] like to the marrow in bones. Some call it the
<i>heart</i> (καρδίαν), others the <i>inside</i> (ἐντεριώνην), yet others call
only the innermost part of the metra itself the heart, while others
again call this <i>marrow</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
He is thus inventing a word to cover all the different kinds of core
and importing it from another study. This is the method of modern
scientific nomenclature which hardly existed for botanists even as late
as the sixteenth century of our era. The real foundations of our modern
nomenclature were laid in the later sixteenth and in the seventeenth
century by Cesalpino and Joachim Jung.</p>

<p>Theophrastus understood the value of developmental study, a conception
derived from his master. ‘A plant’, he says, ‘has power of germination
in all its parts, for it has life in them all, wherefore we should
regard them not for what they are but for what they are becoming.’<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The various modes of plant reproduction are correctly distinguished in
a way that passes beyond the only surviving earlier treatise that deals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in detail with the subject, the Hippocratic work <i>On generation</i>.
‘The manner of generation of trees and plants are these:
spontaneous, from a seed, from a root, from a piece torn off,
from a branch or twig, from the trunk itself, or from pieces
of the wood cut up small.’<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
The marvel of generation must have awakened admiration from a very
early date. We have already seen it occupying a more ancient author,
and it had also been one of the chief pre-occupations of Aristotle. It
is thus not remarkable that the process should impress Theophrastus, who
has left on record his views on the formation of the plant from the seed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘Some germinate, root and leaves, from the same point, some
separately from either end of the seed. Thus wheat, barley, spelt, and
all such cereals [germinate] from either end, corresponding to the
position [of the seed] in the ear, the root from the stout lower part,
the shoot from the upper; but the two, root and stem, form a single
continuous whole. The bean and other leguminous plants are not so, but
in them root and stem are from the same point, namely, their place of
attachment to the pod, where, it is plain, they have their origin. In
some cases there is a process, as in beans, chick peas, and especially
lupines, from which the root grows downward, the leaf and stem
upward.... In certain trees the bud first germinates within the seed,
and, as it increases in size, the seeds split—all such seeds are, as it
were, in two halves; again, all those of leguminous plants have plainly
two lobes and are double—and then the root is immediately thrust out.
But in cereals, the seeds being in one piece, this does not happen, but
the root grows a little before [the shoot].</p>

<p>‘Barley and wheat come up monophyllous, but peas, beans, and chick
peas polyphyllous. All leguminous plants have a single woody root, from
which grow slender side roots ... but wheat, barley, and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
cereals have numerous slender roots by which they are matted
together.... There is a contrast between these two kinds; the
leguminous plants have a single root and have many side-growths above
from the [single] stem ... while the cereals have many roots and send
up many shoots, but these have no side-shoots.’<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that here is a piece of minute observation on the
behaviour of germinating seeds. The distinction between dicotyledons
and monocotyledons is accurately set forth, though the stress is
laid not so much on the cotyledonous character of the seed as on the
relation of root and shoot. In the dicotyledons root and shoot are
represented as springing from the same point, and in monocotyledons
from opposite poles in the seed.</p>

<p>No further effective work was done on the germinating seed until
the invention of the microscope, and the appearance of the work of
Highmore (1613-85),<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
and the much more searching investigations of Malpighi (1628-94)<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and Grew (1641-1712)<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
after the middle of the seventeenth century. The observations of
Theophrastus are, however, so accurate, so lucid, and so complete that
they might well be used as legends for the plates of these writers two
thousand years after him.</p>

<p>Much has been written as to the knowledge of the sex of plants among
the ancients. It may be stated that of the sexual elements of the
flower no ancient writer had any clear idea. Nevertheless, sex is often
attributed to plants, and the simile of the Loves of Plants enters into
works of the poets. Plants are frequently described as male and female
in ancient biological writings also, and Pliny goes so far as to say
that some students considered that all herbs and trees were sexual.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Yet when such passages can be tested it will be found that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
so-called males and females are usually different species. In a few
cases a sterile variety is described as the male and a fertile as the
female. In a small residuum of cases diœcious plants or flowers are
regarded as male and female, but with no real comprehension of the
sexual nature of the flowers. There remain the palms, in which the
knowledge of plant sex had advanced a trifle farther. ‘With dates’,
says Theophrastus, ‘the males should be brought to the females; for the
males make the fruit persist and ripen, and this some call by analogy
<i>to use the wild fig</i> (ὀλυνθάζειν).<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
The process is thus: when the male is in flower they at once cut off
the spathe with the flower and shake the bloom, with its flower and
dust, over the fruit of the female, and, if it is thus treated, it
retains the fruit and does not shed it.’<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The fertilizing character of the spathe of the male date
palm was familiar in Babylon from a very early date. It is recorded by
Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
and is represented by a frequent symbol on the Assyrian monuments.</p>

<p>The comparison of the fertilization of the date palm to the use of the
wild fig refers to the practice of Caprification. Theophrastus tells
us that there are certain trees, the fig among them, which are apt to
shed their fruit prematurely. To remedy this ‘the device adopted is
caprification. Gall-insects come out of the wild figs which are hanging
there, eat the tops of the cultivated figs, and so make them swell’.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
These gall-insects ‘are engendered from the seeds’.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Theophrastus distinguished between the process as applied to the fig and the date,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
observing that ‘in both [fig and date] the male aids the female—for
they call the fruit-bearing [palm] <i>female</i>—but whilst in the
one there is a union of the two sexes, in the other things are
different’.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Theophrastus was not very successful in distinguishing the nature
of the primary elements of plants, though he was able to separate
root, stem, leaf, stipule, and flower on morphological as well
as to a limited extent on physiological grounds. For the root he
adopts the familiar definition, the only one possible before the
rise of chemistry, that it ‘is that by which the plant draws up
nourishment’,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
a description that applies to the account given by the pre-Aristotelian
author of the work περὶ γονῆς, <i>On generation</i>. But Theophrastus shows
by many examples that he is capable of following out morphological
homologies. Thus he knows that the ivy regularly puts forth roots from
the shoots between the leaves, by means of which it gets hold of trees
and walls,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
that the mistletoe will not sprout except on the bark of living trees
into which it strikes its roots, and that the very peculiar formation
of the mangrove tree is to be explained by the fact that ‘this plant
sends out roots from the shoots till it has hold on the ground and
roots again: and so there comes to be a continuous circle of roots
round the tree, not connected with the main stem, but at a distance from
it’.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
He does not succeed, however, in distinguishing the real nature of
such structures as bulbs, rhizomes, and tubers, but regards them all
as roots. Nor is he more successful in his discussion of the nature
of stems. As to leaves, he is more definite and satisfactory, though
wholly in the dark as to their function; he is quite clear that the
pinnate leaf of the rowan tree, for instance, is a leaf and not a branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Notwithstanding his lack of insight as to the nature of sex in flowers,
he attains to an approximately correct idea of the relation of flower
and fruit. Some plants, he says, ‘have [the flower] around the fruit
itself as vine and olive; [the flowers] of the latter, when they drop,
look as though they had a hole through them, and this is taken for a
sign that it has blossomed well; for if [the flower] is burnt up or
sodden, the fruit falls with it, and so it does not become pierced.
Most flowers have the fruit case in the middle, or it may be the flower
is on the top of the pericarp as in pomegranate, apple, pear, plum,
and myrtle ... for these have their seeds below the flower.... In
some cases again the flower is on top of the seeds themselves as in
... all thistle-like plants’.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Thus Theophrastus has succeeded in distinguishing between the
hypogynous, perigynous, and epigynous types of flower, and has almost
come to regard its relation to the fruit as the essential floral element.</p>

<p>Theophrastus has a perfectly clear idea of plant distribution as
dependent on soil and climate, and at times seems to be on the point
of passing from a statement of climatic distribution into one of real
geographical regions. The general question of plant distribution long
remained at, if it did not recede from, the position where he left
it. The usefulness of the manuscript and early printed herbals in the
West was for centuries marred by the retention of plant descriptions
prepared for the Greek East and Latin South, and these works were saved
from complete ineffectiveness only by an occasional appeal to nature.</p>

<p>With the death of Theophrastus about 287 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> pure
biological science substantially disappears from the Greek world, and we get
the same type of deterioration that is later encountered in other
scientific departments. Science ceases to have the motive of the desire
to know, and becomes an applied study, subservient to the practical
arts. It is an attitude from which in the end applied science itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
must suffer also. Yet the centuries that follow were not without
biological writers of very great ability. In the medical school of
Alexandria anatomy and physiology became placed on a firm basis from
about 300 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, but always in the position subordinate to
medicine that they have since occupied. Two great names of that school,
Herophilus and Erasistratus, we must consider elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Their works have disappeared and we have the merest fragments of them.
In the last pre-Christian and the first two post-Christian centuries,
however, there were several writers, portions of whose works have
survived and are of great biological importance. Among them we include
Crateuas, a botanical writer and illustrator, who greatly developed,
if he did not actually introduce, the method of representing plants
systematically by illustration rather than by description. This method,
important still, was even more important when there was no proper
system of botanical nomenclature. Crateuas by his paintings of plants,
copies of which have not improbably descended to our time, began a
tradition which, fixed about the fifth century, remained almost rigid
until the rediscovery of nature in the sixteenth. He was physician to
Mithridates VI Eupator (120-63 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>), but
his work was well known and appreciated at Rome, which became the place
of resort for Greek talent.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Celsus, who flourished about 20 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, wrote an
excellent work on medicine, but gives all too little glimpse of anatomy and
physiology. Rufus of Ephesus, however, in the next century practised
dissection of apes and other animals. He described the decussation of
the optic nerves and the capsule of the crystalline lens, and gave the
first clear description that has survived of the structure of the eye.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
He regarded the nerves as originating from the brain, and distinguished
between nerves of motion and of sensation. He described the oviduct of
the sheep and rightly held that life was possible without the spleen.</p>

<p>The second Christian century brings us two writers who, while
scientifically inconsiderable, acted as the main carriers of such
tradition of Greek biology as reached the Middle Ages, Pliny and
Dioscorides. Pliny (<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 23-79), though a Latin,
owes almost everything of value in his encyclopaedia to Greek writings. In his
<i>Natural History</i> we have a collection of current views on the nature,
origin, and uses of plants and animals such as we might expect from an
intelligent, industrious, and honest member of the landed class who
was devoid of critical or special scientific skill. Scientifically the
work is contemptible, but it demands mention in any study of the legacy
of Greece, since it was, for centuries, a main conduit of the ancient
teaching and observations on natural history. Read throughout the ages,
alike in the darkest as in the more enlightened periods, copied and
recopied, translated, commented on, extracted and abridged, a large
part of Pliny’s work has gradually passed into folk-keeping, so that
through its agency the gipsy fortune-teller of to-day is still reciting
garbled versions of the formulae of Aristotle and Hippocrates of two
and a half millennia ago.</p>

<p>The fate of Dioscorides (flourished <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 60) has been
not dissimilar. His work <i>On Materia Medica</i> consists of a series of short
accounts of plants, arranged almost without reference to the nature of
the plants themselves, but quite invaluable for its terse and striking
descriptions which often include habits and habitats. Its history has
shown it to be one of the most influential botanical treatises ever
penned. It provided most of the little botanical knowledge that reached
the Middle Ages. It furnished the chief stimulus to botanical research
at the time of the Renaissance. It has decided the general form of
every modern pharmacopœia. It has practically determined modern plant
nomenclature both popular and scientific.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Translated into nearly every language from Anglo-Saxon and Provençal
to Persian and Hebrew, appearing both abstracted and in full in
innumerable beautifully illuminated manuscripts, some of which are
still among the fairest treasures of the great national libraries,
Dioscorides, the drug-monger, appealed to scholasticized minds for
centuries. The frequency with which fragments of him are encountered in
papyri shows how popular his work was in Egypt in the third and fourth
centuries. One of the earliest datable Greek codices in existence is a
glorious volume of Dioscorides written in capitals,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
thought worthy to form a wedding gift for a lady who was the daughter of one
Roman emperor and the betrothed of a second.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
The illustrations of this fifth century manuscript are a very valuable monument for
the history of art and the chief adornment of what was once the Royal Library at
Vienna<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
(<a href="#FIG_9-10">figs. 9-10</a>). Illustrated Latin translations of Dioscorides were
in use in the time of Cassiodorus (490-585). A work based on it,
similarly illustrated, but bearing the name of Apuleius, is among
the most frequent of mediaeval botanical documents and the earliest
surviving specimen is almost contemporary with Cassiodorus himself.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
After the revival of learning Dioscorides continued to attract an
immense amount of philological and botanical ability, and scores of
editions of his works, many of them nobly illustrated, poured out of
the presses of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

But the greatest biologist of the late Greek period, and indeed one of
the greatest biologists of all time, was Claudius Galen of Pergamon
(<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 131-201). Galen devoted himself to medicine from
an early age, and in his twenty-first year we hear of him studying anatomy
at Smyrna under Pelops. With the object of extending his knowledge of
drugs he early made long journeys to Asia Minor. Later he proceeded to
Alexandria, where he improved his anatomical equipment, and here, he
tells us, he examined a human skeleton. It is indeed probable that his
direct practical acquaintance with human anatomy was limited to the
skeleton and that dissection of the human body was no longer carried
on at Alexandria in his time. Thus his physiology and anatomy had to
be derived mainly from animal sources. He is the most voluminous of
all ancient scientific writers and one of the most voluminous writers
of antiquity in any department. We are not here concerned with the
medical material which mainly fills these huge volumes, but merely with
the physiological views which not only prevailed in medicine until
Harvey and after, but also governed for fifteen hundred years alike
the scientific and the popular ideas on the nature and workings of the
animal body, and have for centuries been embedded in our speech. A
knowledge of these physiological views of Galen is necessary for any
understanding of the history of biology and illuminates many literary
allusions of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</p>

<p>Between the foundation of the Alexandrian school and the time of Galen,
medicine was divided among a great number of sects. Galen was an
eclectic and took portions of his teaching from many of these schools,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
but he was also a naturalist of great ability and industry, and knew
well the value of the experimental way. Yet he was a somewhat windy
philosopher and, priding himself on his philosophic powers, did not
hesitate to draw conclusions from evidence which was by no means always
adequate. The physiological system that he thus succeeded in building
up we may now briefly consider (<a href="#FIG_11">fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>The basic principle of life, in the Galenic physiology, is a <i>spirit</i>,
<i>anima</i> or <i>pneuma</i>, drawn from the general world-soul in the act of
respiration. It enters the body through the <i>rough artery</i> (τραχεῖα
ἀρτηρία, <i>arteria aspera</i> of mediaeval notation), the organ known to
our nomenclature as the trachea. From this trachea the pneuma passes to
the lung and then, through the <i>vein-like artery</i> (ἀρτηρία φλεβώδης,
<i>arteria venalis</i> of mediaeval writers, the pulmonary vein of our
nomenclature), to the left ventricle. Here it will be best to leave it
for a moment and trace the vascular system along a different route.</p>

<p>Ingested food, passing down the alimentary tract, was absorbed as chyle
from the intestine, collected by the portal vessel, and conveyed by it
to the liver. That organ, the site of the innate heat in Galen’s view,
had the power of elaborating the chyle into venous blood and of imbuing
it with a spirit or pneuma which is innate in all living substance,
so long as it remains alive, the <i>natural spirits</i> (πνεῦμα φυσικόν,
<i>spiritus naturalis</i> of the mediaevals). Charged with this, and also
with the nutritive material derived from the food, the venous blood is
distributed by the liver through the veins which arise from it in the
same way as the arteries from the heart. These veins carry nourishment
and <i>natural spirits</i> to all parts of the body. <i>Iecur fons venarum</i>,
the liver as the source of the veins, remained through the centuries
the watchword of the Galenic physiology. The blood was held to ebb and
flow continuously in the veins during life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Now from the liver arose one great vessel, the hepatic vein, from
division of which the others were held to come off as branches. Of
these branches, one, our <i>common vena cava</i>, entered the right side
of the heart. For the blood that it conveyed to the heart there were
two fates possible. The greater part remained awhile in the ventricle,
parting with its impurities and vapours, exhalations of the organs,
which were carried off by the <i>artery-like vein</i> (φλὲπς ἀρτηριώδης,
the mediaeval <i>vena pulmonalis</i>, our pulmonary artery) to the lung
and then exhaled to the outer air. These impurities and vapours gave
its poisonous and suffocating character to the breath. Having parted
thus with its impurities, the venous blood ebbed back again from the
right ventricle into the venous system. But for a small fraction of
the venous blood that entered the right ventricle another fate was
reserved. This small fraction of venous blood, charged still with
the <i>natural spirits</i> derived from the liver, passed through minute
channels in the septum between the ventricles and entered the left
chamber. Arrived there, it encountered the external pneuma and became
thereby elaborated into a higher form of spirit, the <i>vital spirits</i>
(πνεῦμα ζωτικόν, <i>spiritus vitalis</i>), which is distributed together
with blood by the arterial system to various parts of the body. In the
arterial system it also ebbed and flowed, and might be seen and felt to
pulsate there.</p>

<p>But among the great arterial vessels that sent forth arterial blood
thus charged with vital spirits were certain vessels which ascended
to the brain. Before reaching that organ they divided up into minute
channels, the <i>rete mirabile</i> (πλέγμα μέγιστον θαῦμα), and passing
into the brain became converted by the action of that organ into a yet
higher type of spirits, the <i>animal spirits</i> (πνεῦμα ψυχικόν, <i>spiritus
animalis</i>), an ethereal substance distributed to the various parts of
the body by the structures known to-day as nerves, but believed then
to be hollow channels. The three fundamental faculties (δυνάμεις), the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>natural</i>, the <i>vital</i>, and the <i>animal</i>, which brought into action
the corresponding functions of the body, thus originated as an expression
of the primal force or pneuma.</p>

<p>This physiology, we may emphasize, is not derived from an investigation
of human anatomy. In the human brain there is no <i>rete mirabile</i>,
though such an organ is found in the calf. In the human liver there
is no <i>hepatic vein</i>, though such an organ is found in the dog. Dogs,
calves, pigs, bears, and, above all, Barbary apes were freely dissected
by Galen and were the creatures from which he derived his physiological
ideas. Many of Galen’s anatomical and physiological errors are due to
his attributing to one creature the structures found in another, a fact
that only very gradually dawned on the Renaissance anatomists.</p>

<p>The whole knowledge possessed by the world in the department of
physiology from the third to the seventeenth century, nearly all the
biological conceptions till the thirteenth, and most of the anatomy and
much of the botany until the sixteenth century, all the ideas of the
physical structure of living things throughout the Middle Ages, were
contained in a small number of these works of Galen. The biological
works of Aristotle and Theophrastus lingered precariously in a few
rare manuscripts in the monasteries of the East; the total output of
hundreds of years of Alexandrian and Pergamenian activities was utterly
destroyed; the Ionian biological works, of which a sample has by a
miracle survived, were forgotten; but these vast, windy, ill-arranged
treatises of Galen lingered on. Translated into Latin, Syriac, Arabic,
and Hebrew, they saturated the intellectual world of the Middle Ages.
Commented on by later Greek writers, who were themselves in turn
translated into the same list of languages, they were yet again served
up under the names of such Greek writers as Oribasius, Paul of Aegina,
or Alexander of Tralles.</p>

<p>What is the secret of the vitality of these Galenic biological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
conceptions? The answer can be given in four words. <i>Galen</i> <i>is a
teleologist</i>; and a teleologist of a kind whose views happened to fit
in with the prevailing theological attitude of the Middle Ages, whether
Christian, Moslem, or Jewish. According to him everything which exists
and displays activity in the human body originates in and is formed
by an intelligent being and on an intelligent plan, so that the organ
in structure and function is the result of that plan. ‘It was the
Creator’s infinite wisdom which selected the best means to attain his
beneficent ends, and it is a proof of His omnipotence that he created
every good thing according to His design, and thereby fulfilled His
will.’<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>After Galen there is a thousand years of darkness, and biology ceases
to have a history. The mind of the Dark Ages turned towards theology,
and such remains of Neoplatonic philosophy as were absorbed into the
religious system were little likely to be of aid to the scientific
attitude. One department of positive knowledge must of course persist.
Men still suffered from the infirmities of the flesh and still sought
relief from them. But the books from which that advice was sought had
nothing to do with general principles nor with knowledge as such.
They were the most wretched of the treatises that still masqueraded
under the names of Hippocrates and Galen, mostly mere formularies,
antidotaries, or perhaps at best symptom lists. And, when the
depression of the western intellect had passed its worst, there was
still no biological material on which it could be nourished.</p>

<p>The prevailing interest of the barbarian world, at last beginning to
settle into its heritage of antiquity, was with Logic. Of Aristotle
there survived in Latin dress only the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>De
interpretatione</i>, the merciful legacy of Boethius, the last of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
philosophers. Had a translation of Aristotle’s <i>Historia animalium</i>
or <i>De generatione animalium</i> survived, had a Latin version of the
Hippocratic work <i>On generation</i> or of the treatises of Theophrastus
<i>On plants</i> reached the earlier Middle Ages, the whole mental history
of Europe might have been different and the rediscovery of nature might
have been antedated by centuries. But this was a change of heart for
which the world had long to wait; something much less was the earliest
biological gift of Greece. The gift, when it came, came in two forms,
one of which has not been adequately recognized, but both are equally
her legacy. These two forms are, firstly, the well-known work of the
early translators and, secondly, the tardily recognized work of certain
schools of minor art.</p>

<p>The earliest biological treatises that became accessible in the west
were rendered not from Greek but from Arabic. The first of them was
perhaps the treatise περὶ μυῶν κινήσεως, <i>On movement of muscles</i> of
Galen, a work which contains more than its title suggests and indeed
sets forth much of the Galenic physiological system. It was rendered
into Latin from the Arabic of Joannitius (Hunain ibn Ishaq, 809-73),
probably about the year 1200, by one Mark of Toledo. It attracted
little attention, but very soon after biological works of Aristotle
began to become accessible. The first was probably the fragment <i>On
plants</i>. The Greek original of this is lost, and besides the Latin,
only an Arabic version of a former Arabic translation of a Syriac
rendering of a Greek commentary is now known! Such a work appeared from
the hand of a translator known as Alfred the Englishman about 1220 or a
little later. Neither it nor another work from the same translator, <i>On
the motion of the heart</i>, which sought to establish the primacy of that
organ on Aristotelian grounds, can be said to contain any of the spirit
of the master.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
A little better than these is the work of the wizard Michael the Scot
(1175?-1234?). Roger Bacon tells us that Michael in 1230 ‘appeared
[at Oxford], bringing with him the works of Aristotle in natural
history and mathematics, with wise expositors, so that the philosophy
of Aristotle was magnified among the Latins’. Scott produced his work
<i>De animalibus</i> about this date and he included in it the three great
biological works of Aristotle, all rendered from an inferior Arabic
version.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Albertus Magnus (1206-80) had not as yet a translation direct from
the Greek to go upon for his great commentary on the <i>History of
animals</i>, but he depended on Scott. The biological works of
Aristotle were rendered into Latin direct from the Greek in the
year 1260 probably by William of Moerbeke.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Such translations, appearing in the full scholastic age when everything
was against direct observation, cannot be said to have fallen on a
fertile ground. They presented an ordered account of nature and a good
method of investigation, but these were gifts to a society that knew
little of their real value.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Yet the advent of these texts was coincident with a returning desire to
observe nature. Albert, with all his scholasticism, was no contemptible
naturalist. He may be said to have begun first-hand plant study in
modern times so far as literary records are concerned. His book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<i>De vegetabilibus</i> contains excellent observations, and he is worthy
of inclusion among the fathers of botany. In his vast treatise <i>De
animalibus</i>, hampered as he is by his learning and verbosity, he shows
himself a true observer and one who has absorbed something of the
spirit of the great naturalist to whose works he had devoted a lifetime
of study and on which he professes to be commenting. We see clearly
the leaven of the Aristotelian spirit working, though Albert is still
a schoolman. We may select for quotation a passage on the generation
of fish, a subject on which some of Aristotle’s most remarkable
descriptions remained unconfirmed till modern times. These descriptions
impressed Albert in the same way as they do the modern naturalist. To
those who know nothing of the stimulating power of the Aristotelian
biological works, Albert’s description of the embryos of fish and his
accurate distinction of their mode of development from that of birds,
by the absence of an allantoic membrane in the one and its presence in
the other, must surely be startling. Albert depends on Aristotle—a
third-hand version of Aristotle—but does not slavishly follow him.</p>

<p>‘Between the mode of development (<i>anathomiam generationis</i>) of birds’
and fishes’ eggs there is this difference: during the development of
the fish the second of the two veins which extend from the heart [as
described by Aristotle in birds] does not exist. For we do not find
the vein which extends to the outer covering in the eggs of birds
which some wrongly call the navel because it carries the blood to the
exterior parts; but we do find the vein that corresponds to the yolk
vein of birds, for this vein imbibes the nourishment by which the limbs
increase.... In fishes as in birds, channels extend from the heart
first to the head and the eyes, and first in them appear the great
upper parts. As the growth of the young fish increases the albumen
decreases, being incorporated into the members of the young fish, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
it disappears entirely when development and formation are complete. The
beating of the heart ... is conveyed to the lower part of the belly,
carrying pulse and life to the inferior members.</p>

<p>‘While the young [fish] are small and not yet fully developed they have
veins of great length which take the place of the navel-string, but as
they grow and develop, these shorten and contract into the body towards
the heart, as we have said about birds. The young fish and the eggs are
enclosed and in a covering, as are the eggs and young of birds. This
covering resembles the dura mater [of the brain], and beneath it is
another [corresponding therefore to the pia mater of the brain] which
contains the young animal and nothing else.’<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In the next century Conrad von Megenberg (1309-98) produced his <i>Book
of Nature</i>, a complete work on natural history, the first of the kind
in the vernacular, founded on Latin versions, now rendered direct
from the Greek, of the Aristotelian and Galenic biological works. It
is well ordered and opens with a systematic account of the structure
and physiology of man as a type of the animal creation, which is then
systematically described and followed by an account of plants. Conrad,
though guided by Aristotle, uses his own eyes and ears, and with him
and Albert the era of direct observation has begun.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>But there was another department in which the legacy of Greece found
an even earlier appreciation. For centuries the illustrations to
herbals and bestiaries had been copied from hand to hand, continuing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
tradition that had its rise with Greek artists of the first century
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> But their work, copied at each stage without
reference to the object, moved constantly farther from resemblance to the
original. At last the illustrations became little but formal patterns,
a state in which they remained in some late copies prepared as recently
as the sixteenth century. But at a certain period a change set in, and
the artist, no longer content to rely on tradition, appeals at last to
nature. This new stirring in art corresponds with the new stirring in
letters, the Arabian revival—itself a legacy of Greece, though sadly
deteriorated in transit—that gave rise to scholasticism. In much of
the beautiful carved and sculptured work of the French cathedrals the
new movement appears in the earlier part of the thirteenth century.
At such a place as Chartres we see the attempt to render plants and
animals faithfully in stone as early as 1240 or before. In the easier
medium of parchment the same tendency appears even earlier. When once
it begins the process progresses slowly until the great recovery of the
Greek texts in the fifteenth century, when it is again accelerated.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century the energy of botanists and zoologists was
largely absorbed in producing most carefully annotated and illustrated
editions of Dioscorides and Theophrastus and accounts of animals,
habits, and structure that were intended to illustrate the writings of
Aristotle, while the anatomists explored the bodies of man and beast
to confirm or refute Galen. The great monographs on birds, fishes, and
plants of this period, ostensibly little but commentaries on Pliny,
Aristotle, and Dioscorides, represent really the first important
efforts of modern times at a natural history. They pass naturally into
the encyclopaedias of the later sixteenth century, and these into the
physiological works of the seventeenth. Aristotle was never a dead hand
in Biology as he was in Physics, and this for the reason that he was a
great biologist but was not a great physicist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>With the advance of the sixteenth century the works of Aristotle, and
to a less extent those of Dioscorides and Galen, became the great
stimulus to the foundation of a new biological science. Matthioli
(1520-77), in his commentary on Dioscorides (first edition 1544), which
was one of the first works of its type to appear in the vernacular,
made a number of first-hand observations on the habits and structure
of plants that is startling even to a modern botanist. About the same
time Galenic physiology, expressed also in numerous works in the
vulgar tongue and rousing the curiosity of the physicians, became the
clear parent of modern physiology and comparative anatomy. But, above
all, the Aristotelian biological works were fertilizers of the mind.
It is very interesting to watch a fine observer such as Fabricius ab
Acquapendente (1537-1619) laying the foundations of modern embryology
in a splendid series of first-hand observations, treating his own great
researches almost as a commentary on Aristotle. What an impressive
contrast to the arid physics of the time based also on Aristotle! ‘My
purpose’, says Fabricius, ‘is to treat of the formation of the foetus
in every animal, setting out from that which proceeds from the egg: for
this ought to take precedence of all other discussion of the subject,
both because it is not difficult to make out Aristotle’s view of the
matter, and because his treatise on the Formation of the Foetus from
the egg is by far the fullest, and the subject is by much the most
extensive and difficult.’<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The industrious and careful Fabricius, with a wonderful talent for
observation lit not by his own lamp but by that of Aristotle, bears
a relation to the master much like that held by Aristotle’s pupil
in the flesh, Theophrastus. The works of the two men, Fabricius and
Theophrastus, bear indeed a resemblance to each other. Both rely on the
same group of general ideas, both progress in much the same ordered
calm from observation to observation, both have an inspiration which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
efficient and stimulating but below the greatest, both are enthusiastic
and effective as investigators of fact, but timid and ineffective in
drawing conclusions.</p>

<p>But Fabricius was more happy in his pupils than Theophrastus, for
we may watch the same Aristotelian ideas fermenting in the mind of
Fabricius’s successor, the greatest biologist since Aristotle himself,
William Harvey (1578-1657).<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
This writer’s work <i>On generation</i> is a careful commentary on
Aristotle’s work on the same topic, but it is a commentary not in
the old sense but in the spirit of Aristotle himself. Each statement
is weighed and tested in the light of experience, and the younger
naturalist, with all his reverence for Aristotle, does not hesitate
to criticize his conclusions. He exhibits an independence of thought,
an ingenuity in experiment, and a power of deduction that places his
treatise as the middle term of the three great works on embryology of
which the other members are those of Aristotle and Karl Ernst von Baer
(1796-1870).<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>With the second half of the seventeenth century and during a large part
of the eighteenth the biological works of Aristotle attracted less
attention. The battle against the Aristotelian physics had been fought
and won, but with them the biological works of Aristotle unjustly
passed into the shadow that overhung all the idols of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The rediscovery of the Aristotelian biology is a modern thing. The
collection of the vast wealth of living forms absorbed the energies
of the generations of naturalists from Ray (1627-1705) and Willoughby
(1635-72) to Réaumur (1683-1757) and Linnaeus (1707-1778) and beyond to
the nineteenth century. The magnitude and fascination of the work seems
almost to have excluded general ideas. With the end of this period and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the advent of a more philosophical type of naturalist, such as Cuvier
(1769-1832) and members of the Saint-Hilaire family, Aristotle came
again to his own. Since the dawn of the nineteenth century, and since
naturalists have been in a position to verify the work of Aristotle,
his reputation as a naturalist has continuously risen. Johannes Müller
(1801-58), Richard Owen (1804-92), George Henry Lewes (1817-78),
William Ogle (1827-1912) are a few of the long line of those who
have derived direct inspiration from his biological work. With
improved modern methods of investigation the problems of generation
have absorbed a large amount of biological attention, and interest
has become specially concentrated on Aristotle’s work on that topic
which is perhaps, at the moment, more widely read than any biological
treatise, ancient or modern, except the works of Darwin. That great
naturalist wrote to Ogle in 1882: ‘From quotations I had seen I had a
high notion of Aristotle’s merits, but I had not the most remote notion
what a wonderful man he was. Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods,
though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle.’</p>

 <h2>GREEK MEDICINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Ἡρόφιλος δὲ ᾝἐν τῷ Διαιτητικῷ καὶ σοφίαν φησὶν
ἀνεπίδεικτον καὶ τέχνην ἄδηλον καὶ ἰσχὺν ἀναγώνιστον καὶ πλοῦτον
ἀχρεῖον καὶ λόγον ἀδύνατον, ὑγιείας ἀπούσης.</p>

<p>Herophilus, a Greek philosopher and physician (<i>c.</i> 300 <span class="smcap">b.
c.</span>), has truly written ‘that Science and Art have equally nothing
to show, that Strength is incapable of effort, Wealth useless, and
Eloquence powerless if Health be wanting’.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
All peoples therefore have had their methods of treating those
departures from health that we call disease, and among peoples of
higher culture such methods have been reduced in most cases to
something resembling a system. In antiquity, as now, a variety of
such systems were in vogue, and those nations who practised the art
of writing from an early date have left considerable records of their
medical methods and doctrines. We may thus form a fairly good idea of
the medical principles of the Mesopotamian, the Egyptian, the Iranian,
the Indian, and the Chinese civilizations. Much in these systems, as
in the medical procedure of more primitive tribes, was based upon some
theory of disease which fitted in with a larger theory of the nature
of evil. Of these theories the commonest was and is the demonic, the
view that regards deviation from the normal state of health as due
either to the attacks of supernatural beings or to their actual entry
into the body of the sufferer. A medical system based on such a view is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
susceptible of great elaboration in a higher civilization, but not being founded on
observation is hardly capable of indefinite development, for a
point must ultimately be reached at which the mind recoils from
complex conclusions far remote from observed phenomena. The medicine
of the ancient and settled civilization of such a people as the
Assyro-Babylonians, for instance, of which substantial traces have
been recovered, is hardly, if at all, more effective, though far more
systematized, than that of many a wild and unlettered tribe that may
be observed to-day. Of such medicine as this we may give an account,
but we can hardly write a <i>history</i>. We cannot establish those elements
of continuity and of development from which alone history can be constructed.</p>

<p>It is the distinction of the Greeks alone among the nations of
antiquity that they practised a system of medicine based not on theory
but on observation accumulated systematically as time went on. The
claim can be made for the Greeks that some at least among them were
deflected by no theory, were deceived by no theurgy, were hampered by
no tradition in their search for the facts of disease and in their
attempts at interpreting its phenomena. Only the Greeks among the
ancients could look on their healers as <i>physicians</i> (= naturalists,
φύσις = nature), and that word itself stands as a lasting reminder of
their achievement.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>At a certain stage in the history of the Western world—the exact point
in time may be disputed but the event is admitted by all—men turned
to explore the treasures of the ancient wisdom and the whole mass of
Greek medical learning was gradually laid before the student. That mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
contained much dross, material that survived from early as from late
Greek times which was hardly, if at all, superior to the debased
compositions that circulated in the name of medicine in the middle
centuries. But the recovered Greek medical writings also contained some
material of the purest and most scientific type, and that material and
the spirit in which it was written, form the debt of modern medicine to
antiquity.</p>

<p>It is a debt the value of which cannot be exaggerated. The physicians
of the revival of learning, and for long after, doubtless pinned their
faith too much to the written word of their Greek forbears and sought
to imprison the free spirit of Hippocrates and Galen in the rigid
wall of their own rediscovered texts. The great medical pioneers of
a somewhat later age, enraged by this attempt, the real nature of
which was largely hidden from them, not infrequently revolted and
rightly revolted against the bondage to the Greeks in which they had
been brought up. Yet it is sure that these modern discoverers were
the true inheritors of the Greeks. Without Herophilus we should have
had no Harvey and the rise of physiology might have been delayed for
centuries; had Galen’s works not survived, Vesalius would never have
reconstructed Anatomy, and Surgery too might have stayed behind with
her laggard sister, Medicine; the Hippocratic collection was the
necessary and acknowledged basis for the work of the greatest of modern
clinical observers, Thomas Sydenham, and the teaching of Hippocrates
and of his school is the substantial basis of instruction in the wards
of a modern hospital. In the pages which follow we propose therefore
to review the general character of medical knowledge in the best Greek
period and to consider briefly how much of that great heritage remained
accessible to the earlier modern physicians. The reader will thus be
able to form some estimate of the degree to which the legacy has been
passed on to our own times.</p>

<p>It is evident that among such a group of peoples as the Greeks, varying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in state of civilization, in mental power, in geographical and economic
position and in general outlook, the practice of medicine can have
been by no means uniform. Without any method of centralizing medical
education and standardizing teaching there was a great variety of
doctrines and of practice in vogue among them, and much of this was on
a low level of folk custom. Such lower grade material of Greek origin
has come down to us in abundance, though much of it, curiously enough,
from a later time. But the overwhelming mass of earlier Greek medical
literature sets forth for us a pure scientific effort to observe and
to classify disease, to make generalizations from carefully collected
data, to explain the origin of disease on rational grounds, and to
apply remedies, when possible, on a reasoned basis. We may thus rest
fairly well assured that, despite serious and irreparable losses, we
are still in possession of some of the very finest products of the
Greek medical intellect.</p>

<p>There is ample evidence that the Greeks inherited, in common with many
other peoples of Mediterranean and Asiatic origin, a whole system of
magical or at least non-rational pharmacy and medicine from a remoter
ancestry. Striking parallels can be drawn between these folk elements
among the Greeks and the medical systems of the early Romans, as well
as with the medicine of the Indian Vedas, of the ancient Egyptians, and
of the earliest European barbarian writings. It is thus reasonable to
suppose that these elements, when they appear in later Greek writings,
represent more primitive folk elements working up, under the influence
of social disintegration and consequent mental deterioration, through
the upper strata of the literate Greek world. But with these elements,
intensely interesting to the anthropologist, the psychologist, the
ethnologist, and to the historian of religion, we are not here greatly
concerned. Important as they are, they constitute no part of the
special claim of the Greek people to distinction, but rather aid us in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
uniting the Greek mentality with that of other kindred peoples. Here we
shall rather discuss the course of Greek scientific medicine proper,
the type of medical doctrine and practice, capable of development
in the proper sense of the word, that forms the basis of our modern system.
We are concerned, in fact, with the earliest evolutionary medicine.</p>

<p>We need hardly discuss the first origins of Greek Medicine. The
material is scanty and the conclusions somewhat doubtful and
perhaps premature, for the discovery of a considerable fragment of
the historical work of Menon, a pupil of Aristotle, containing a
description of the views of some of the precursors of the Hippocratic
school, renews a hope that more extended investigation may yield
further information as to the sources and nature of the earliest Greek
medical writings.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The study of Mesopotamian star-lore has linked it up with early
Greek astronomical science. The efforts of cuneiform scholars have
not, however, been equally successful for medicine, and on the whole
the general tendency of modern research is to give less weight to
Mesopotamian and more to Egyptian sources than had previously been
admitted; thus, as an instance, some prescriptions in the Ebers
papyrus of the eighteenth dynasty (about the sixteenth century <span
class="smcap">b. c.</span>) discovered at Thebes in 1872 resemble
certain formulae in the Corpus Hippocraticum. A number of drugs, too,
habitually used by the Greeks, such as <i>Andropogon</i>, <i>Cardamoms</i>, and
<i>Sesame orientalis</i>, are of Indian origin. There are also the Minoan
cultures to be considered, and our knowledge is not yet sufficient to
speak of the heritage that Greek medicine may or may not have derived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
from that source, though it seems not improbable that Greek hygiene may
here owe a debt.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Omitting, therefore, this early epoch, we pass direct to the later
period, between the sixth and fourth centuries, from which documents
have actually come down to us.</p>

<p>The earliest medical school of which we have definite information is
that of Cnidus, a Lacedaemonian colony in Asiatic Doris. Its origin
may perhaps reach back to the seventh century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
We have actual records that the teachers of Cnidus were accustomed to collect
systematically the phenomena of disease, of which they had produced
a very complex classification, and we probably possess also several
of their actual works. The physicians of Cos, their only contemporary
critics whose writings have survived, considered that the Cnidian
physicians paid too much attention to the actual sensations of the
patient and to the physical signs of the disease. The most important
of the Cnidian doctrines were drawn up in a series of <i>Sentences</i> or
Aphorisms, and these, it appears, inculcated a treatment along Egyptian
lines of the symptom or at most the disease, rather than the patient,
a statement borne out by the contents of the gynaecological works
of probable Cnidian origin included in the so-called ‘Hippocratic
Collection’. A few names of Cnidian physicians have, moreover, come
down to us with titles of their works, and a later statement that they
practised anatomy. There can be little doubt too that the Cnidian
school drew also on Persian and Indian Medicine.</p>

<p>The origin of the school of the neighbouring island of Cos was a
little later than that of Cnidus and probably dates from the sixth
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Of the Coan school, or at least of the
general tendencies that it represented, we have a magnificent and copious
literary monument in the Corpus Hippocraticum, a collection which was
probably put together in the early part of the third century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
by a commission of Alexandrian scholars at the order of the book-loving
Ptolemy Soter (reigned 323-285 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>). The elements
of which this collection is composed are of varying dates from the sixth to the
fourth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and of varying value and origin,
but they mainly represent the point of view of physicians of the eastern
part of the Greek world in the fifth and fourth centuries.</p>

<p>The most obvious feature, the outstanding element that at once
strikes the modern observer in these ‘Coan’ writings, is the enormous
emphasis laid on the actual course of disease. ‘It appears to me a
most excellent thing’, so opens one of the greatest of the Hippocratic
works, ‘for a physician to cultivate <i>pronoia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Foreknowing and foretelling in the presence of the sick the past,
present, and future (of their symptoms) and explaining all that the
patients are neglecting, he would be believed to understand their
condition, so that men would have confidence to entrust themselves to
his care.... Thus he would win just respect and be a good physician. By
an earlier forecast in each case he would be more able to tend those
aright who have a chance of surviving, and by foreseeing and stating
who will die, and who will survive, he will escape blame....’<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Just as the Cnidians by dividing up diseases according to symptoms
over-emphasized diagnosis and over-elaborated treatment, so the Coans
laid very great force on prognosis and adopted therefore a largely
expectant attitude towards diseases. Both Cnidian and Coan physicians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
were held together by a common bond which was, historically if not
actually, related to temple worship. Physicians leagued together in the
name of a god, as were the Asclepiadae, might escape, and did escape,
the baser theurgic elements of temple medicine. Of these they were as
devoid as a modern Catholic physician might be expected to be free from
the absurdities of Lourdes. But the extreme cult of prognosis among
the Coans may not improbably be traced back to the medical lore of the
temple soothsayers whose divine omens were replaced by indications of
a physical nature in the patient himself.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We are tempted too to
link it with that process of astronomical and astrological prognosis
practised in the Mesopotamian civilizations from which Ionia imitated
and derived so much. Religion had thus the same relation to medicine
that it would have with a modern ‘religious’ medical man as suggesting
the motive and determining the general direction of his practice though
without influence on the details and method.</p>

<p>During the development of the Coan medical school along these lines in
the sixth and fifth centuries, there was going on a most remarkable
movement at the very other extreme of the Greek world. Into the course
and general importance of Sicilian philosophy it is not our place to
enter, but that extraordinary movement was not without its repercussion
on medical theory and practice. Very important in this direction was
Empedocles of Agrigentum (<i>c.</i> 500-<i>c.</i> 430 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>).
His view that the blood is the seat of the ‘innate heat’, ἔμφυτον θερμόν, he
took from folk belief—‘the blood is the life’—and this innate heat
he closely identified with soul. More profitable was his doctrine
that breathing takes place not only through what are now known as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
respiratory passages but also through the pores of the skin. His
teaching led to a belief in the heart as the centre of the vascular
system and the chief organ of the ‘pneuma’ which was distributed by
the blood vessels. This pneuma was equivalent to both soul and life,
but it was something more. It was identified with air and breath, and
the pneuma could be seen to rise as shimmering steam from the shed
blood of the sacrificial victim—for was not the blood its natural
home? There was a pneuma, too, that interpenetrated the universe around
us and gave it those qualities of life that it was felt to possess.
Anaximenes (<i>c.</i> 610-<i>c.</i> 545 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>), an
Ionian predecessor of Empedocles, may be said to have defined for us these
functions of the pneuma; οῖον ἡ ψυχὴ ἡ ἡμετέρα ἀὴρ οῧσα συγκρατεί ἡμᾶς, ὅλον
τὸν κόσμον πνεῦμα καὶ ἀὴρ περιέχει ‘As our soul, being air, sustains
us, so pneuma and air pervade the whole universe’;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
but it is the speculation of Empedocles himself that came to be regarded
as the basis of the Pneumatic School in Medicine which had later very
important developments.</p>

<p>Another early member of the Western school who made important
contributions to medical doctrine—in which relation alone we need
consider him—was Pythagoras of Samos (<i>c.</i> 580-<i>c.</i> 490 <span class="smcap">b.
c.</span>). For him number, as the purest conception, formed the basis of
philosophy. Unity was the symbol of perfection and corresponded to God
Himself. The material universe was represented by 2, and was divided by
the number 12, whence we have 3 worlds and 4 spheres. These in turn,
according at least to the later Pythagoreans, give rise to the four
elements, earth, air, fire, and water—a primary doctrine of medicine
and of science derived perhaps from ancient Egypt and surviving for
more than two millennia. The Pythagoreans taught, too, of the existence
of an animal soul, an emanation of the soul of the universe. In all
this we may distinguish the germ of that doctrine of the relation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
man and universe, microcosm and macrocosm, which, suppressed as
irrelevant in the Hippocratic works, reappears in the Platonic and
especially in the Neoplatonic writings, and forms a very important
dogma in later medicine.</p>

<p>A pupil of Pythagoras and an older contemporary of Empedocles was
Alcmaeon of Croton (<i>c.</i> 500 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>), who began
to construct a positive basis for medical science by the practice of dissection
of animals, and discovered the optic nerves and the Eustachian tubes. He
even extended his researches to Embryology, describing the head of
the foetus as the first part to be developed—a justifiable deduction
from appearances. Alcmaeon introduced also the doctrine that health
depends on harmony, disease on discord of the elements within the
body. Curiosity as to the distribution of the vessels was excited by
Empedocles and Alcmaeon and led to further dissection, and Alcmaeon’s
pupils Acron (<i>c.</i> 480 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) and Pausanias
(<i>c.</i> 480 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>), and the later Philistion of
Lokri,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
the contemporary of Plato, all made anatomical investigations.</p>

<p>The views of Empedocles, and especially his doctrine that regarded
the heart as the main site of the pneuma, though rejected by the Coan
school as a whole, were not without influence on Ionia. Diogenes
of Apollonia, the philosopher of pneumatism, a late fifth century
writer who must have been contemporary with Hippocrates the Great,
himself made an investigation of the blood vessels; and the influence
of the same school may be traced in a little work περὶ καρδίης, <i>On
the heart</i>, which is the best anatomical treatise of the Hippocratic
Collection. This work describes the aorta and the pulmonary artery as
well as the three valves at the root of each of the great vessels,
and it speaks of experiments to test their validity. It treats of the
pericardium and of the pericardial fluid and perhaps of the musculi
papillares, and contrasts the thickness of the walls of right and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ventricles. The author considers that the left ventricle is empty of
blood—as indeed it is after death—and is the source of the innate
heat and of the absolute intelligence. These views fit in with the
doctrines of Empedocles, so that we may perhaps even venture to
regard this work as a surviving document of the Sicilian school. It
is interesting to observe that we have here the first hint of human
dissection, for the author tells us that the hearts of animals may be
compared to that of man. The distinction of having been the first to
write on human anatomy, as such, belongs however, probably to a later
writer, Diocles, son of Archidamus of Carystus, who lived in the fourth
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>We may now turn to the Hippocratic Corpus as a whole. This collection
consists of about 60 or 70 separate works, written at various periods
and in various states of preservation. At best only a very small
proportion of them can be attributed to Hippocrates, but the discussion
of the general question of the ‘genuineness’ of the works is now
admitted to be futile, for it is certain that we have no criteria
whatever to determine whether or no a particular work be from the pen
of the Father of Medicine, and the most we can ever say of such a
treatise is that it appears to be of his school and in his spirit. Yet
among the great gifts of this collection to our time and to all time
are two which stand out above all others, the picture of a man, and the
picture of a method.</p>

<p>The man is Hippocrates himself. Of the actual details of his life we
know next to nothing. His period of greatest activity falls about 400
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> He seems to have led a wandering life. Born
of a long line of physicians in the island of Cos, he exerted his activities
in Thrace, Abdera, Delos, the Propontis (Cyzicus), Thasos, Thessaly
(notably at Larissa and Meliboea), Athens, and elsewhere, dying at
Larissa in extreme old age about the year 377 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
He had many pupils, among whom were his two sons Thessalus and Dracon, who
also undertook journeys, his son-in-law Polybus, of whose works a
fragment has been preserved for us by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
together with three other Coans bearing the names Apollonius,
Dexippus, and Praxagoras. This is practically all we know of him with
certainty. But though this glimpse is very dim and distant, yet we
cannot exaggerate the influence on the course of medicine and the
value for physicians of all time of the traditional picture that was
early formed of him and that may indeed well be drawn again from the
works bearing his name. In beauty and dignity that figure is beyond
praise. Perhaps gaining in stateliness what he loses in clearness,
Hippocrates will ever remain the type of the perfect physician.
Learned, observant, humane, with a profound reverence for the claims
of his patients, but an overmastering desire that his experience shall
benefit others, orderly and calm, disturbed only by anxiety to record
his knowledge for the use of his brother physicians and for the relief
of suffering, grave, thoughtful and reticent, pure of mind and master
of his passions, this is no overdrawn picture of the Father of Medicine
as he appeared to his contemporaries and successors. It is a figure of
character and virtue which has had an ethical value to medical men of
all ages comparable only to the influence exerted on their followers
by the founders of the great religions. If one needed a maxim to place
upon the statue of Hippocrates, none could be found better than that
from the book Παραγγελίαι, <i>Precepts</i>:</p>

The numerous busts of him which have reached our time are no portraits.
But the best of them are something much better and more helpful to us
than any portrait. They are idealized representations of the kind of
man a physician should be and was in the eyes of the best and wisest of
the Greeks. (<a href="#FIG_1-2B">See Fig. 1</a>.)</p>

<p>The method of the Hippocratic writers is that known to-day as the
‘inductive’. Without the vast scientific heritage that is in our own
hands, with only a comparatively small number of observations drawn
from the Coan and neighbouring schools, surrounded by all manner of
bizarre oriental religions in which no adequate relation of cause and
effect was recognized, and above all constantly urged by the exuberant
genius for speculation of that Greek people in the midst of whom they
lived and whose intellectual temptations they shared, they remain
nevertheless, for the most part, patient observers of fact, sceptical
of the marvellous and the unverifiable, hesitating to theorize beyond
the data, yet eager always to generalize from actual experience; calm,
faithful, effective servants of the sick. There is almost no type of
mental activity known to us that was not exhibited by the Greeks and
cannot be paralleled from their writings; but careful and constant
return to verification from experience, expressed in a record of
actual observations—the habitual method adopted in modern scientific
departments—is rare among them except in these early medical authors.</p>

<p>The spirit of their practice cannot be better illustrated than by the
words of the so-called ‘Hippocratic oath’:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">‘I swear by Apollo the healer, and Asclepius, and
Hygieia, and All-heal (Panacea) and all the gods and goddesses ... that,
according to my ability and judgement, I will keep this Oath and
this stipulation—to reckon him who taught me this Art as dear to
me as those who bore me ... to look upon his offspring as my own
brothers, and to teach them this Art, if they would learn it, without
fee or stipulation. By precept, lecture, and all other modes of
instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and
those of my teacher, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath
according to the Law of Medicine, but to none other. I will follow
that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgement,
I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever
is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to any
one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; nor will I aid a woman to
produce abortion. With purity and holiness I will pass my life and
practise my Art.... Into whatever houses I enter, I will go there for
the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every act of mischief
and corruption; and above all from seduction.... Whatever in my
professional practice—or even not in connexion with it—I see or hear
in the lives of men which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not
divulge, deeming that on such matters we should be silent. While I
keep this Oath unviolated, may it be granted me to enjoy life and the
practice of the Art, always respected among men, but should I break or
violate this Oath, may the reverse be my lot.’</p>

<p>Respected equally throughout the ages by Arab, Jew, and Christian,
the oath remains the watchword of the profession of medicine.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
The ethical value of such a declaration could not escape the attention even
of a Byzantine formalist, and it is interesting to observe that in our
oldest Greek manuscript of the Hippocratic text, dating from the tenth
century, this magnificent passage is headed by the words ‘from the oath
of Hippocrates according as it may be sworn by a Christian.’<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>When we examine the Hippocratic corpus more closely, we discern that
not only are the treatises by many hands, but there is not even a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
uniform opinion and doctrine running through them. This is well brought
out by some of the more famous of the phrases of this remarkable
collection. Thus a well-known passage from the <i>Airs, Waters, and
Places</i> tells us that the Scythians attribute a certain physical
disability to a god, ‘but it appears to me’, says the author, ‘that
these affections are just as much divine as are all others and that no
disease is either more divine or more human than another, but that all
are equally divine, for each of them has its own nature, and none of
them arise without a natural cause.’ But, on the other hand, the author
of the great work on <i>Prognostics</i> advises us that when the physician
is called in he must seek to ascertain the nature of the affections
that he is treating, and especially ‘if there be anything divine in the
disease, and to learn a foreknowledge of this also.’<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
We may note too that this sentence almost immediately precedes what
is perhaps the most famous of all the Hippocratic sentences, the
description of what has since been termed the <i>Hippocratic facies</i>.
This wonderful description of the signs of death may be given as an
illustration of the habitual attitude of the Hippocratic school towards
prognosis and of the very careful way in which they noted details:</p>

<p class="blockquot">‘He [the physician] should observe thus in acute
diseases: first, the countenance of the patient, if it be like to
those who are in health, <i>and especially if it be like itself, for
this would be the best</i>; but the more unlike to this, the worse it is;
such would be these: <i>sharp nose, hollow eyes, collapsed temples</i>;
<i>ears cold, contracted, and their lobes turned out</i>; <i>skin about the
forehead rough, distended, and parched</i>; <i>the colour of the whole face
greenish or dusky</i>. If the countenance be so at the beginning of the
disease, and if this cannot be accounted for from the other symptoms,
inquiry must be made whether he has passed a sleepless night; whether
his bowels have been very loose; or whether he is suffering from
hunger; and if any of these be admitted the danger may be reckoned as
less; and it may be judged in the course of a day and night if the
appearance of the countenance proceed from these. But if none of these
be said to exist, and the symptoms do not subside in that time, be it
known for certain that death is at hand.’<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Again, in the work <i>On the Art [of Medicine]</i> we read: ‘I hold it to
be physicianly to abstain from treating those who are overwhelmed by
disease’,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
a prudent if inhumane procedure among a people who might regard the
doctor’s powers as partaking of the nature of magic, and perhaps a wise
course to follow at this day in some places not very far from Cos. Yet
in the book <i>On Diseases</i> we are advised even in the presence of an
incurable disease ‘to give relief with such treatment as is possible’.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, works by authors of the Hippocratic school stand sometimes
in a position of direct controversy with each other. Thus in the
treatise <i>On the Heart</i> an experiment is set forth which is held to
prove that a part at least of imbibed fluid passes into the cavity
of the lung and thence to the parts of the body, a popular error in
antiquity which recurs in Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>. This view, however, is
specifically held to be fallacious by the author of the work <i>On
Diseases</i>, who is supported by a polemical section in the surviving
Menon fragment.</p>

<p>Passages like these have convinced all students that we have to deal
in this collection with a variety of works written at different dates
by different authors and under different conditions, a state that may
be well understood when we reflect that among the Greeks medicine was
a progressive study for a far longer period of time than has yet been
the case in the Western world. An account of such a collection can
therefore only be given in the most general fashion. The system or
systems of medicine that we shall thus attempt to describe was in vogue
up to the Alexandrian period, that is, to the beginning of the third
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Anatomy and physiology, the basis of our modern system, was still a
very weak point in the knowledge of the pre-Alexandrians. The surface
form of the body was intimately studied in connexion especially with
fractures, but there is no evidence in the literature of the period of
any closer acquaintance with human anatomical structure.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The same fact is well borne out by Greek Art, for in its noblest period
the artist betrays no evidence of assistance derived from anatomization.
Such evidence is not found until we come to sculpture of Alexandrian
date, when the somewhat strained attitudes and exaggerated musculature
of certain works of the school of Pergamon suggest that the artist
derived hints, if not direct information, from anatomists who, we know,
were active at that time. It is not improbable, however, that separate
bones, if not complete skeletons, were commonly studied earlier, for
the surgical works of the Hippocratic collection, and especially those
on fractures and dislocations, give evidence of a knowledge of the
relations of bones to each other and of their natural position in
the body which could not be obtained, or only obtained with greatest
difficulty, without this aid.</p>

<p>There are in the Hippocratic works a certain number of comparisons
between human and animal structures that would have been made possible
by surgical operations and occasional accidents. The view has been put
forward that some anatomical knowledge was derived through the practice
of augury from the entrails of sacrificial animals. It appears,
however, improbable that a system so scientific and so little related
to temple practice would have had much to learn from these sources,
and, moreover, since we know that animals were actually dissected as
early as the time of Alcmaeon it would be unnecessary to invoke the aid
of the priests. The unknown author of the περὶ τόπων τῶν κατὰ ἄνθρωπον,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<i>On the sites of [diseases] in man</i>, a work written about 400
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, declares indeed that ‘physical structure
is the basis of medicine’, but the formal treatises on anatomy that we possess
from Hippocratic times give the general anatomical standard of the corpus,
and it is a very disappointing one. The tract <i>On Anatomy</i>, though
probably of much later date (perhaps <i>c.</i> 330 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>),
is inferior even to the treatise <i>On the Heart</i> (perhaps of about 400
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>).</p>

<p>Physiology and Pathology are almost as much in the background as
anatomy in the Hippocratic collection. As a formal discipline and
part of medical education we find no trace of these studies among
the pre-Alexandrian physicians. But the meagreness of the number of
ascertained facts did not prevent much speculation among a people eager
to seek the causes of things. Of that speculation we learn much from
the fragments of contemporary medical writers and philosophers, from
the medical works of the Alexandrian period, and to some extent from
the Hippocratic writings themselves. But the wiser and more sober among
the writers of the Hippocratic corpus were bent on something other
than the causes of things. Their pre-occupation was primarily with the
suffering patient, and the best of them therefore excluded—and we may
assume consciously—all but the rarest references to such speculation.</p>

<p>The general state of health of the body was considered by the
Hippocratists to depend on the distribution of the four elements,
earth, air, fire, and water, whose mixture (<i>crasis</i>) and cardinal
properties, dryness, warmth, coldness, and moistness, form the body
and its constituents. To these correspond the cardinal fluids, blood,
phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. The fundamental condition of life
is the <i>innate heat</i>, the abdication of which is death. This innate
heat is greatest in youth when most fuel is therefore required, but
gradually declines with age. Another necessity for the support of
life is the <i>pneuma</i> which circulates in the vessels. All this may
seem fanciful enough, but we may remember that the first half of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
nineteenth century had waned before the doctrine of the humours which
had then lasted for at least twenty-two centuries became obsolete, and
perhaps it still survives in certain modern scientific developments.
Moreover, the finest and most characteristic of the Hippocratic works
either do not mention or but casually refer to these theories which are
not essential to their main pre-occupation. Their task of observation
of symptoms, of the separation of the essentials from the accidents of
disease, and of generalization from experience could go on unaffected
by any view of the nature of man and of the world. Even treatment,
which must almost of necessity be based on <i>some</i> theory of causation,
was little deflected by a view of elements and humours on which it was
impossible to act directly, while therapeutics was further safeguarded
from such influence by the doctrine of <i>Nature as the healer of
diseases</i>, νούσων φύσεις ἰητροί, the <i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>
of the later Latin writers and of the present day.</p>

<p>Diseases are to be cured, in the Hippocratic view, by restoring the
disturbed harmony in the relation of the elements and humours. These,
in fact, tend naturally to an equilibrium and in most cases if left to
themselves will be brought to this state by the natural tendency to
recovery. The process is known as <i>pepsis</i> or, to give it the Latin
form, <i>coctio</i>, and the turning-point at which the effects of this
process exhibit themselves is the <i>crisis</i>, a term which, together
with some of its original content, has still a place in medicine. Such
a turning-point does in fact occur in many diseases, especially those
of a zymotic character, on certain special days, though undue emphasis
was laid by the Greek physicians upon the exact numerical character
of the event. It was no unimportant duty of the physician to assist
nature by bringing his remedies to bear at the critical times. If the
crisis is wanting, or if the remedies are applied at the wrong moment,
the disease may become incurable. But diseases were only immediately
or proximately caused by disturbances in the balance or harmony of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
humours. This was a mere hypothesis, as the Hippocratists themselves
well knew. There were other more remote causes which came into the
actual purview of the physician, conditions which he could and did
study. Such conditions were, for instance, injudicious modes of life,
exposure to climatic changes, advancing age, and the like. Many of
these could be directly corrected. But for those that could not there
were various therapeutic measures at hand.</p>

<p>That human bodies are and normally remain in a state of health, and
that on the whole they tend to recover from disease, is an attitude
so familiar to us to-day that we scarcely need to be reminded of it.
We live some twenty-three centuries later than Hippocrates; for some
sixteen of those centuries the civilized world thought that to retain
health periodical bleedings and potions were necessary; for the last
century or two we have been gradually returning on the Hippocratic
position!</p>

<p>The chief glory of the Hippocratic collection regarded from the
clinical point of view is perhaps the actual description of cases. A
number of these—forty-two in all—have survived.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
They are not only unique as a collection for nearly 2,000 years, but
they are still to this day models of what succinct clinical records
should be, clear and short, without a superfluous word, yet with all
that is most essential, and exhibiting merely a desire to record
the most important facts without the least attempt to prejudge the
case. They illustrate to the full the Greek genius for seizing on
the essential. The writer show’s not the least wish to exalt his own
skill. He seeks merely to put the data before the reader for his
guidance under like circumstances. It is a reflex of the spirit of full
honesty in which these men lived and worked that the great majority
of the cases are recorded to have died. Two of this remarkable little
collection may be given:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">‘The woman with quinsy, who lodged with Aristion:
her complaint began in the tongue; voice inarticulate; tongue red and
parched. <i>First day</i>, shivered, then became heated. <i>Third day</i>, rigor,
acute fever; reddish and hard swelling on both sides of neck and chest;
extremities cold and livid; respiration elevated; drink returned by the
nose; she could not swallow; alvine and urinary discharges suppressed.
<i>Fourth day</i>, all symptoms exacerbated. <i>Fifth day</i>, she died.’</p>

<p>We probably have here to do with a case of diphtheria. The quinsy,
the paralysis of the palate leading to return of the food through
the nose, and the difficulty with speech and swallowing are typical
results of this affection which was here complicated by a spread of
the septic processes into the neck and chest, a not uncommon sequela
of the disease. The rapid onset of the conditions is rather unusual,
but may be explained if we regard the case as a mild and unnoticed
diphtheria, subsequently complicated by paralysis and by secondary
septic infection, for which reasons she came under observation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">‘In Thasos, the wife of Delearces who lodged on
the plain, through sorrow was seized with an acute and shivering fever.
From first to last she always wrapped herself up in her bedclothes;
kept silent, fumbled, picked, bored and gathered hairs [from the
clothes]; tears, and again laughter; no sleep; bowels irritable, but
passed nothing; when urged drank a little; urine thin and scanty;
to the touch the fever was slight; coldness of the extremities.
<i>Ninth day</i>, talked much incoherently, and again sank into silence.
<i>Fourteenth day</i>, breathing rare, large, and spaced, and again hurried.
<i>Seventeenth day</i>, after stimulation of the bowels she passed even
drinks, nor could retain anything; totally insensible; skin parched
and tense. <i>Twentieth day</i>, much talk, and again became composed,
then voiceless; respiration hurried. <i>Twenty-first day</i>, died. Her
respiration throughout was rare and large; she was totally insensible;
always wrapped up in her bedclothes; throughout either much talk, or
complete silence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
This second case is in part a description of low muttering delirium,
a common end of continued fevers such as, for instance, typhoid. The
description closely resembles the condition known now in medicine as
the ‘typhoid state’. Incidentally the case contains a reference to
a type of breathing common among the dying. The respiration becomes
deep and slow, as it sinks gradually into quietude and becomes rarer
and rarer until it seems to cease altogether, and then it gradually
becomes more rapid and so on alternately. This type of breathing is
known to physicians as ‘Cheyne-Stokes’ respiration in commemoration
of two distinguished Irish physicians of the last century who brought
it to the attention of medical men.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Recently it has been partially explained on a physiological basis.
We may note that there is another and even better pen-picture of
Cheyne-Stokes respiration in the Hippocratic collection. It is in the
famous case of ‘Philescos who lived by the wall and who took to his bed
on the first day of acute fever’. About the middle of the sixth day
he died and the physician notes that ‘the respiration throughout was
<i>like that of a person recollecting himself</i> and was large and rare’.
Cheyne-Stokes breathing is admirably described as ‘that of a person
recollecting himself’.</p>

<p>Such records as these may be contrasted with certain others that have
come down from Greek antiquity. We may instance two steles discovered
at Epidaurus in 1885, bearing accounts of forty-four temple cures. The
following two are fair samples of the cures there described:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘<i>Aristagora of Troizen.</i> She had tape-worm, and while she slept
in the Temple of Asclepius at Troizen, she saw a vision. She thought
that, as the god was not present, but was away in Epidaurus, his sons
cut off her head, but were unable to put it back again. Then they sent
a messenger to Asklepius asking him to come to Troizen. Meanwhile day
came, and the priest actually saw her head cut off from the body.
The next night Aristagora had a dream. She thought the god came from
Epidaurus and fastened her head on to her neck. Then he cut open her
belly, and stitched it up again. So she was cured.’</p>

<p>‘A man had an abdominal abscess. He saw a vision, and thought that
the god ordered the slaves who accompanied him to lift him up and hold
him, so that his abdomen could be cut open. The man tried to get away,
but his slaves caught him and bound him. So Asclepius cut him open, rid
him of the abscess, and then stitched him up again, releasing him from
his bonds. Straightway he departed cured, and the floor of the Abaton
was covered with blood.’<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the records of almost all temple cures, a great number of which
have survived in a wide variety of documents, an essential element is
the process of ἐγκοίμησις, <i>incubation</i> or temple sleep, usually in a
special sleeping-place or Abaton. The process has a close parallel in
certain modern Greek churches and in places of worship much further
West; there are even traces of it in these islands, and it is more than
probable that the Christian practice is descended by direct continuity
from the pagan.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
The whole character of the temple treatment was—and is—of a kind to
suggest to the patient that he should dream of the god, an event
which therefore usually takes place. Such treatment by suggestion is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
applicable only to certain classes of disease and is always liable to
fall into the hands of fanatics and impostors. The difficulty that the
honest practitioner encounters is that the sufferer, in the nature
of the case, can hardly be brought to believe that his ailment is
what in fact it is, a lesion of the mind. It is this which gives the
miracle-monger his chance.</p>

<p>Examine for a moment the two cases from Epidaurus, which are quite
typical of the series. We observe that the first is described simply
as a case of ‘tape-worm’ without any justification for the diagnosis.
It is not unfrequent nowadays for thin and anxious patients to state,
similarly without justification, that they suffer from this condition.
They attribute certain common gastric experiences to this cause of
which perhaps they have learned from sensational advertisements,
and then they ask cure for a condition which they themselves have
diagnosed, but which has no existence in fact. Such a case is often
appropriately treated by suggestion. Though the elaborateness of the
suggestion in the temple cure is a little startling, yet it can easily
be paralleled from the legends of the Christian saints. Moreover, we
must remember that we are not here dealing with an account set down by
the patient herself, but with an edificatory inscription put up by the
temple officials.</p>

<p>In the second inscription, the man with an abdominal abscess, we have
a much simpler state of affairs. It is evident that an operation was
actually performed by the priest masquerading as Asclepius, while the
patient was held down by the slaves. He is assured that all is a dream
and departs cured with the tell-tale comment ‘and the floor of the
Abaton was covered with blood’.</p>

<p>These cases might be multiplied indefinitely without great profit for
our particular theme, for in such matters there is no development, no
evolution, no history. There can be no doubt that a very large part
of Greek practice was on this level, as is a small part of modern
medicine, but it is not a level with which we are here dealing and we
shall therefore pass it by. But a word of caution must be added. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
temple worship has been compared with modern psycho-analysis. That
method, like all methods, has doubtless been abused at times; but it is
in essence, unlike the temple system, a purely scientific process by
which the ultimate basis of the patient’s delusions are laid bare and
demonstrated to him.</p>

<p>There is indeed another side to these Asclepian temples. They gradually
developed along the lines of our health resorts and developed many of
the qualities—lovely and unlovely—that we associate with certain
continental watering places. On the bad side they became gossiping
centres or even something little better than brothels, as we may gather
from the <i>Mimes</i> of Herondas. On the good side they formed a quiet
refuge among beautiful and interesting surroundings where the sick,
exhausted, and convalescent might gain the benefits that accrue from
pure air, fine scenery, and a regular and regulated mode of life. It is
more than probable too that the open air and manner of living benefited
many cases of incipient phthisis.</p>

<p>Returning to the Hippocratic collection, the purely surgical treatises
will be found no less remarkable than those of clinical observation.
A very able surgeon, Francis Adams (1796-1861), who was eminent as a
Greek scholar, gave it as his opinion in the middle of the nineteenth
century that no systematic writer on surgery up to his time had given
so good and so complete an account of certain dislocations, notably of
the hip-joint, as that to be found in the Hippocratic collection. Some
types of injury to the hip, as described in the Hippocratic writings,
were certainly otherwise quite inadequately known until described
by Sir Astley Cooper (1768-1841), himself a peculiarly Hippocratic
character.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
The verdict of Adams was probably just, though since his time
the surgery of dislocations, aided especially by X-rays, has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
enabled to pass very definitely beyond the Hippocratic position.
Admirable, too, is the Hippocratic description of dislocation of
the shoulder and of the jaw. In dislocation of hip, shoulder, or
jaw, as in most similar lesions, there is considerable deformity
produced. The nature and meaning of this deformity is described with
remarkable exactness by the Hippocratic writer, who also sets forth
the resulting disability. The principles and indeed the very details
of treatment in these cases are, save for the use of an anaesthetic,
practically identical with those of the present day. The processes are
unfortunately not suitable for detailed quotation and description here,
but they are of special interest since a graphic record of them has
come down to us. There exists in the Laurentian Library at Florence
a ninth century Greek surgical manuscript which contains figures of
surgeons reducing the dislocations in question. There is good reason to
suppose that these miniatures are copied from figures first prepared
in pre-Christian times many centuries earlier, and we may here see the
actual processes of reduction of such fractures, as conducted by a
surgeon of the direct Hippocratic tradition<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
(<a href="#FIG_3-4B">see Figs. 3, 4</a>).</p>

<p>In keeping with all this is most of the surgical work of the
collection. We are almost startled by the modern sound of the whole
procedure as we run through the rough notebook κατ’ ἰητρεῖον,
<i>Concerning the Surgery</i>, or the more elaborate treatise περὶ ἰητροῦ,
<i>On the Physician</i>, where we may read minute directions for the
preparation of the operating-room, and on such points as the management
of light both artificial and natural, scrupulous cleanliness of
the hands, the care and use of the instruments, with the special
precautions needed when they are of iron, the decencies to be observed
during the operation, the general method of bandaging, the placing of
the patient, the use and abuse of splints, and the need for tidiness,
order, and cleanliness. Many of these directions are enlarged upon in
other surgical works of the collection, among which we find especially
full instructions for bandaging and for the diagnosis and treatment
of fractures and dislocations. A very fair representation of such a
surgery as these works describe is to be found on a vase-painting
of Ionic origin which is of the fifth century and therefore about
contemporary with Hippocrates himself (<a href="#FIG_05B">see fig. 5</a>).
There are also several beautiful representations on vases of the actual
processes of bandaging (<a href="#FIG_06B">fig. 6</a>).</p>

Among the surgical procedures of which descriptions are to be found in
the Hippocratic writings are the opening of the chest for the condition
known as <i>empyema</i> (accumulation of pus within the pleura frequently
following pneumonia), and trephining the skull in cases of fracture of
that part—two fundamental operations of modern surgery. Surgical art
has advanced enormously in our own times, yet a text-book containing
much that is useful to this day might be prepared from these surgical
contents of the collection alone.</p>

<p>When we pass to the works on Medicine, in the restricted sense, we
enter into a region more difficult and perhaps even more fascinating.
We are no longer dealing with simple lesions of known origin, but with
the effects of disease and degeneration, of the essential character
of which the Hippocratic writers could in the nature of the case know
very little. Rigidly guarding themselves from any attempt to explain
disease by more immediate and hypothetical causes and thus diverting
the reader’s energies in the medically useless direction of vague
speculation—the prevalent mental vice of the Greeks—the best of these
physicians are content if they can put forward generalized conclusions
from actually observed cases. Many of their thoughts have now become
household words, and they have become so, largely as a direct heritage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
from these ancient physicians. But it must be remembered that ideas so
familiar to us were with them the result of long and carefully recorded
experience and are like nothing that we encounter in the medicine of
other ancient nations. Such conclusions are best set forth perhaps
in the wonderful book of the <i>Aphorisms</i> from which we may permit
ourselves a few quotations:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

          From a vase-painting.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
       <p>In the centre sits a physician holding a lancet and bleeding a
         patient from the median vein at the bend of the right elbow into a
        large open basin. Above and behind the physician are suspended three
        cupping vessels. To the right sits another patient awaiting his turn;
        his left arm is bandaged in the region of the biceps. The figure beyond
        him smells a flower, perhaps as a preservative against infection.
        Behind the physician stands a man leaning on a staff; he is wounded in
        the left leg, which is bandaged. By his side stands a dwarfish figure
        with disproportionately large head, whose body exhibits deformities
        typical of the developmental disease now known as <i>Achondroplasia</i>;
        in addition to these deformities we note that his body is hairy and
        the bridge of his nose sunken; on his back he carries a hare which is
        almost as tall as himself. Talking to the dwarf is a man leaning on a
        long staff, who has the remains of a bandage round his chest.</p>

          the elbow. The treatment of the hands, a department in which Euphronios
          excelled, is particularly fine. Achilles was not a trained surgeon,
          and it will be observed, from the position of the two tails of the
          bandage, that he will have some difficulty when it comes to its final fastening!</p>

<p>In this one memorable paragraph, so condensed in the original as
to be almost untranslatable, he who ‘first separated medicine from
philosophy’ puts aside at once all speculative interest while in the
actual presence of the sick. His whole energy is concentrated on the
case in hand with that peculiar attitude, at once impersonal and
intensely personal, that has since been the mark of the physician, and
that has made of Medicine both a science and an art.</p>

<p>‘The old have generally fewer complaints than young; but those chronic

<p>Here we have a group of observations, some of which have become
literally household words, nor is it difficult to understand how
such sayings have passed from professional into lay keeping. This
magnificent book of <i>Aphorisms</i> was very early translated into Latin,
probably before and certainly not later than the sixth century of
the Christian era, and thus became accessible throughout the West.
Manuscripts of this Latin version, dating from the ninth and tenth
centuries of our era, have survived in the actual places in which they
were written, at Monte Cassino in Southern Italy and at Einsiedeln in
Switzerland, and in 991 the book of <i>Aphorisms</i> was well known and
closely studied at the Cathedral school of Chartres. From France the
<i>Aphorisms</i> reached England, and they are mentioned in documents of the
tenth or eleventh century. By now, too, the book had been translated
into Syriac and later into Arabic and Hebrew, so that in the true
mediaeval period it was known both East and West, and in the vernacular
as well as the classical tongues. From the oriental dialects several
further translations were again made into Latin. An enormous number of
manuscripts of the work have survived in almost every Western dialect,
and these show on the whole that the text has been surprisingly little
tampered with. In the middle of the thirteenth century some of the
better-known Aphorisms were absorbed into a very popular Latin poem
that went forth in the name of the medical school of Salerno, though
with a false ascription to a yet earlier date. The Salernitan poem,
being itself translated into every European vernacular, further helped
to bring Hippocrates into every home.</p>

<p>But by no means all the Aphorisms are of a kind that could well become
absorbed into folk medicine. It is only those concerning frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
recurring states to which this fate could befall. The book contains
also a number of notes on rare conditions seldom seen or noted save by
medical men. Such are the following very acute observations:</p>

<p>‘Spasm supervening on a wound is fatal.’</p>

<p>‘Those seized with tetanus die within four days, or if they survive so
long they recover.’</p>

<p>‘A convulsion, or hiccup, supervening on a copious discharge of blood
is bad.’</p>

<p>‘If after severe and grave wounds no swelling appears, it is very
serious.’</p>

<p>These four sentences all concern wounds. The first two refer to the
disease <i>tetanus</i>, which is very liable to supervene on wounds fouled
with earth, especially in hot and moist localities. The disease is
characterized by a series of painful muscular contractions which in
the more severe and fatal form may become a continuous spasm, a type
that is referred to in the first sentence. It is true of tetanus that
the later the onset after the wound is sustained the better the chance
of recovery. This is brought out by the second sentence. The third and
fourth sentences record untoward symptoms following a severe wound,
now well recognized and watched for by every surgeon. There were, of
course, innumerable illustrations of the truth of these Aphorisms in
extensive wounds, especially those involving crushed limbs, in the late war.</p>

<p>‘Phthisis occurs most commonly between the ages of eighteen and
thirty-five.’</p>

<p>‘Diarrhœa supervening on phthisis is mortal.’</p>

<p>The period given by the <i>Aphorisms</i> for the maximum frequency of onset
of the disease is closely borne out by modern observations. The second
Aphorism is equally valid; continued diarrhœa is a very frequent
antecedent of the fatal event in chronic phthisis, and post-mortem
examination has shown that secondary involvement of the bowel is an
exceedingly common condition in this disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>No less remarkable is the following saying: ‘In jaundice it is a grave
matter if the liver becomes indurated.’ Jaundice is a common and
comparatively trivial symptom following or accompanying a large variety
of diseases. In and by itself it is of little importance and almost
always disappears spontaneously. There is a small group of pathological
conditions, however, in which this is not the case. The commonest and
most important of these are the fatal affections of cirrhosis and
cancer of the liver in which that organ may be felt to be enlarged and
hardened. If therefore the liver can be so felt in a case of jaundice,
it is, as the Aphorism says, of gravest import. Representations of
such cases have actually come down to us from Greek times. Thus on
a monument erected at Athens to the memory of a physician who died
in the second century of the Christian era we may see the process of
clinical examination (<a href="#FIG_07C">fig. 7</a>). The physician is palpating
the liver of a dwarfish figure whose swollen belly, wasted limbs, and anxious
look tell of some such condition as that described in the Aphorism. The
ridge caused by the enlarged liver can even be detected on the statue.</p>

<p>‘We must attend to the appearances of the eyes in sleep as presented
from below; for if a portion of the white be seen between the closing
eyelids, and if this be not connected with diarrhœa or severe purging,
it is a very bad and mortal symptom.’ In this, the last Aphorism which
we shall quote, we see the Hippocratic physician actually making his
observations. Now during sleep the eyeball is turned upward, so that
if the eye be then opened and examined only the white is seen. In the
later stages of all wasting and chronic diseases the eyelids tend not
to be closed during sleep. Such patients, as is well known, often die
with the eyes open and sometimes exhibiting only the whites.</p>

<p>But the Hippocratic physician was not content to make only passive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
observation; he also took active measures to elicit the ‘physical
signs’. In modern times a large, perhaps the chief, task of the student
of medicine is to acquire a knowledge of these so-called physical
signs of disease, the tradition of which has been gradually rebuilt
during the last three centuries. Among the most important measures
in which he learns to acquire facility is that of auscultation. This
useful process has come specially into vogue since the invention of
the stethoscope in 1819 by Laennec, who derived valuable hints for it
from the Hippocratic writings. Auscultation is several times mentioned
and described by the Hippocratic physicians, who used the direct
method of listening and not the mediate method devised by Laennec.
There are, however, certain cases in which the modern physician still
finds the older non-instrumental Hippocratic method superior. In the
Hippocratic work περὶ νούσων, <i>On diseases</i>, we read of a case with
fluid in the pleura that ‘you will place the patient on a seat which
does not move, an assistant will hold him by the shoulders, and you
will shake him, applying the ear to the chest, so as to recognize on
which side the sign occurs’. This sign is still used by physicians and
is known as <i>Hippocratic succussion</i>. In another passage in the same
work the symptoms of pleurisy are described and ‘a creak like that of
leather may be heard’. This is the well known <i>pleuritic rub</i> which the
physician is accustomed to seek in such cases, and of which the creak
of leather is an excellent representation.</p>

<p>Such quotations give an insight into the general method and attitude
of the Hippocratics. Of an art such as medicine, which even in those
times had a long and rational tradition behind it, it is impossible to
give more than the merest glimpse in such a review as this. The actual
practice is far too complex to set down briefly. This is especially the
case with the ancient teaching as regards epidemic disease at which
we must cursorily glance. The Hippocratic physicians and indeed all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
antiquity were as yet ignorant of the nature, and were but dimly
aware of the existence, of infection.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
For them acute disease was something imposed on the patient from
outside, but how it reached him from outside and what it was that thus
reached him they were still admittedly ignorant. In this dilemma they
turned to prolonged observation and noted as a result of repeated
experience that epidemic diseases in their world had characteristic
seasonal and regional distributions. One country was not quite like
another, nor was one season like another nor even one year like
another. By a series of carefully collated observations as to how
regions, seasons, and years differed from each other, they succeeded
in laying the basis of a rational study of epidemiology which gave
rise to the notion of an ‘epidemic constitution’ of the different
years, a conception which was very fertile and stimulating to the great
clinicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is by no
means without value even for the modern epidemiologist. The work of the
modern fathers of epidemiology was consciously based on Hippocrates.</p>

<p>Before parting with the Hippocratic physician a word must be said as
to his therapeutic means. His general armoury may be described as
resembling that of the modern physician of about two generations ago.
During those two generations we have, it is true, added to our list of
effective remedies but, on the other hand, there has been by common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
consent a return to the Hippocratic simplicity of treatment. After
rest and quiet the central factor in treatment was Dietetics. This
science regarded the age—‘Old persons use less nutriment than young’;
the season—‘In winter abundant nourishment is wholesome, in summer
a more frugal diet’; the bodily condition—‘Lean persons should take
little food, but this little should be fat, fat persons on the other
hand should take much food, but it should be lean’. Respect was
also paid to the digestibility of different foods—‘white meat is
more easily digestible than dark’—and to their preparation. Water,
barley water, and lime water were recommended as drinks. The dietetic
principles of the Hippocratics, especially in connexion with fevers,
are substantially those of the present day, and it may be said that
the general medical tendency of the last generation in these matters
has been an even closer approximation to the Hippocratic. ‘The more we
nourish unhealthy bodies the more we injure them’; ‘The sick upon whom
fever seizes with the greatest severity from the very outset, must at
once subject themselves to a rigid diet’; ‘Complete abstinence often
acts well, if the strength of the patient can in any way sustain it’;
yet ‘We should examine the strength of the sick, to see whether they be
in condition to maintain this spare diet to the crisis of the disease’.
‘In the application of these rules we must always be mindful of the
strength of the patient and of the course of each particular disease,
as well as of the constitution and ordinary mode of life in each disease.’</p>

<p>Besides diet the Hippocratic physician had at his disposal a
considerable variety of other remedies. Baths, inunctions, clysters,
warm and cold suffusions, massage and gymnastic, as well as gentler
exercise are among them. He probably employed cupping and bleeding
rather too freely, and we have several representations of the
instruments used for these operations (<a href="#FIG_08B">fig. 8</a>). He was
no great user of drugs and seldom names them except, we may note, in the works
on the treatment of women, which are probably of Cnidian origin and whence the
greater part of the 300 constituents of the Hippocratic pharmacopœia
are derived. Thus his list of drugs is small, but several known to him
are still used by us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The work of these men may be summed up by saying that without
dissection, without any experimental physiology or pathology, and
without any instrumental aid they pushed the knowledge of the course
and origin of disease as far as it is conceivable that men in such
circumstances could push it. This was done as a process of pure
scientific induction. Their surgery, though hardly based on anatomy,
was grounded on the most carefully recorded experience. In therapeutics
they allowed themselves neither to be deceived by false hopes nor led
aside by vain traditions. Yet in diagnosis, prognosis, surgery and
therapeutics alike they were in many departments unsurpassed until
the nineteenth century, and to some of their methods we have reverted
in the twentieth. Persisting throughout the ages as a more or less
definite tradition, which attained clearer form during and after the
sixteenth century, Hippocratic methods have formed the basis of all
departments of modern advance.</p>

<p>But the history of Greek medicine did not end with the Hippocratic
collection; in many respects it may indeed be held only to begin there;
yet we never get again a glimpse of so high an ethical and professional
standard as that which these works convey. From Alexandrian times
onwards, too, the history of Greek medicine becomes largely a history
of various schools of medical thought, each of which has only a partial
view of the course and nature of medical knowledge. The unravelling of
the course and teachings of these sects has long been a pre-occupation
of professed medical historians, but the general reader can hardly
take an interest in differences between the Dogmatists, Empirics, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Methodists whose doctrines are as dead as themselves. In this later
Alexandrian and Hellenistic age the Greek intellect is no less active
than before, but there is a change in the taste of the material. A
general decay of the spirit is reflected in the medical as in the
literary products of the time, and we never again feel that elevation
of a beautiful and calmly righteous presence that breathes through the
Hippocratic collection and gives it a peculiar aroma.</p>

<p>We shall pass over the general course of later Greek medicine with
great rapidity. A definite medical school was established at Alexandria
and others perhaps at Pergamon and elsewhere. Athens, after the death
of Aristotle and his pupils, passes entirely into the background and is
of no importance so far as medicine is concerned. At Alexandria, where
a great medical library was collected, anatomy began to be studied and
two men whose discoveries were of primary importance for the history of
that subject, Erasistratus and Herophilus, early practised there. With
anatomy as a basis medical education could become much more systematic.
It is a very great misfortune that the works of these two eminent men
have disappeared. Of Herophilus fragments have survived embedded in
the works of Galen (<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 130-201), Caelius Aurelianus
(fifth century), and others. These fragments have been the subject of one of
the earliest, most laborious, and most successful attempts made in
modern times to reconstruct the lost work of an ancient author.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
For Erasistratus our chief source of information are two polemical
treatises directed against him by Galen. Recently, too, a little more
information concerning the works of both men has become available from
the Menon papyrus.</p>

<p>It has been found possible to reconstruct especially a treatise on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
anatomy by Herophilus with a considerable show of probability. He
opened by giving general directions for the process of dissection and
followed with detailed descriptions of the various systems, nervous,
vascular, glandular, digestive, generative, and osseous. There was a
separate section on the liver, a small part of which has survived.
It is of his account of the nervous system that we have perhaps the
best record, and it is evident that he has advanced far beyond the
Hippocratic position. In the braincase he saw the membranes that cover
the brain and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. He
attained to some knowledge of the ventricles of the brain, the cranial
and spinal nerves, the nerves of the heart, and the coats of the eye.
He distinguished the blood sinuses of the skull, and the <i>torcular
Herophili</i> (winepress of Herophilus), a sinus described by him, has
preserved his name in modern anatomical nomenclature. He even made out
more minute structures, such as the little depression in the fourth
ventricle of the brain, known to modern anatomists as the <i>calamus
scriptorius</i>, which still bears the name which he gave it (κάλαμος ῷ
γράφομεν), because it seemed to him, as Galen tells us, to resemble
the pens then in use in Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
We still use, too, his term <i>duodenum</i> (δωδεκαδάκτυλος ἔκφυσις = twelve-finger extension),
for as Galen assures us, Herophilus ‘so named the first part of the intestine
before it is rolled into folds‘.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
The duodenum is a U-shaped section of the intestine following
immediately on the stomach. Being fixed down behind the abdominal
cavity it cannot be further convoluted, and this accounts for Galen’s
description of it. It is about twelve fingers’ breadth long in the
animals dissected by Herophilus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Erasistratus, the slightly younger Alexandrian contemporary of
Herophilus, has the credit of further anatomical discoveries. He
described correctly the action of the epiglottis in preventing the
entrance of food and drink into the windpipe during the act of
swallowing, he saw the lacteal vessels in the mesentery, and pursued
further the anatomy of the brain. He improved on the anatomy of the
heart, and described the auriculo-ventricular valves and their mode
of closure. He distinguished clearly the motor and sensory nerves. He
seems to have adopted a definitely experimental attitude—a very rare
thing among ancient physicians—and a description of an experiment
made by him has recently been recovered. ‘If ’, he says, ‘you take an
animal, a bird, for example, and keep it for a time in a jar without
giving it food and then weigh it together with its excreta you will
find that there is a considerable loss of weight.’<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
The experiment is a simple one, but it was about nineteen hundred years
before a modern professor, Sanctorio Santorio (1561-1636), thought of
repeating it.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The anatomical advances made by the Alexandrian school naturally
reacted on surgical efficiency. The improvement so effected may be
gathered, for instance, from an account of the anatomical relationships
in certain cases of dislocation of the hip given by the Alexandrian
surgeon Hegetor, who lived about 100 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> In his book περὶ
αἰτιῶν, <i>On causes [of disease]</i>, he asks ‘why (certain surgeons) do
not seek another way of reducing a luxation of the hip.... If the
joints of the jaw, shoulder, elbow, knee, finger, &amp;c., can be replaced,
the same, they think, must be true of all parts, nor can they give an
account of why the femur cannot be put back into its place.... They
might have known, however, that from the head of the femur arises a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
ligament which is inserted into the socket of the hip bone ... and if
this ligament is once ruptured the thigh bone cannot be retained in
place’.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
This passage contains the first description of the structure known to
modern anatomists as the <i>ligamentum teres</i>, a strong fibrous band
which unites the head of the femur with the socket into which it
fits in the hip bone, like the string that binds the cup and ball of
a child’s toy. This ligament is ruptured in certain severe cases of
dislocation of the hip.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the school at Alexandria, medical teaching
rapidly became organized, but throughout the whole course of
antiquity it suffered from the absence of anything in the nature of
a state diploma. Any one could practise, with the result that many
quacks, cranks, and fanatics were to be found among the ranks of the
practitioners who often were or had been slaves. The great Alexandrian
school, however, did much to preserve some sort of professional
standard, and above all its anatomical discipline helped to this end.</p>

<p>Between the founding of the Alexandrian school and Galen we are not
rich in medical writings. Apart from fragments and minor productions,
the works of only five authors have survived from this period of
over four hundred years, namely, Celsus, Dioscorides, Aretaeus of Cappadocia,
and two Ephesian authors bearing the names of Rufus and Soranus.</p>

<p>The work of Celsus of the end of the first century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
 is a Latin treatise, probably translated from Greek, and is the surviving
medical volume of a complete cyclopaedia of knowledge. In spite of its
unpromising origin it is an excellent compendium of its subject and
shows a good deal of advance in many respects beyond the Hippocratic
position. The moral tone too is very high, though without the lofty and
detached beauty of Hippocrates. Anatomy has greatly improved, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
it surgical procedure, and the work is probably representative of the
best Alexandrian practice. The pharmacopœia is more copious, but has
not yet become burdensome. The general line of treatment is sensible
and humane and the language concise and clear. Among other items he
describes dental practice, with the indications for and methods of
tooth extraction, the wiring of teeth, and perhaps a dental mirror.
There is an excellent account of what might be thought to be the modern
operation for removal of the tonsils. Celsus is still commemorated
in modern medicine by the <i>area Celsi</i>, a not uncommon disease of
the skin. The <i>De re medica</i> is in fact one of the very best medical
text-books that have come down to us from antiquity. It has had a
romantic history. Forgotten during the Middle Ages, it was brought
to light by the classical scholar Guarino of Verona (1374-1460)
in 1426, and a better copy was discovered by his friend Lamola in
1427. Another copy was found by Thomas Parentucelli (1397-1455),
afterwards Pope Nicholas V in 1443, and the text was later studied by
Politian (1454-94). Though one of the latest of the great classical
medical texts to be discovered, it was one of the first to be printed
(Florence, 1478), and it ran through very many early editions and had
great influence on the medical renaissance.</p>

<p>After Celsus comes Dioscorides in the first century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>
He was a Greek military surgeon of Cilician origin who served under Nero,
and in him the Greek intellect is obviously beginning to flag. His work
is prodigiously important for the history of botany, yet so far as
rational medicine is concerned he is almost negligible. He begins at
the wrong end, either giving lists of drugs with the symptoms that they
are said to cure or to relieve, or lists of symptoms with a series of
named drugs. Clinical observation and record are wholly absent, and the
spirit of Hippocrates has departed from this elaborate pharmacopœia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
With the second century of the Christian era we terminate the creative
period of Greek medicine. We are provided with the works of four
important writers of this century, of whom three, Rufus of Ephesus,
Soranus of Ephesus, and Aretaeus of Cappadocia, though valuable for
forming a picture of the state of medicine in their day, were without
substantial influence on the course of medicine in later ages.</p>

<p>Rufus of Ephesus, a little junior to Dioscorides, has left us the first
formal work on human anatomy and is of some importance in the history
of comparative anatomy. In medicine he is memorable as the first to
have described bubonic plague, and in surgery for his description of
the methods of arresting haemorrhage and his knowledge of the anatomy
of the eye. A work by him <i>On gout</i> was translated into Latin in the
sixth century, but remained unknown till modern times.</p>

<p>Soranus of Ephesus (<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> <i>c.</i> 90-<i>c.</i> 150),
an acute writer on gynaecology, has left a book which illustrates well the anatomy
of his day. It exercised an influence for many centuries to come, and a
Latin abstract of it prepared about the sixth century by one Moschion
has come down to us in an almost contemporary manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
It is interesting as opposing the Hippocratic theory that the male embryo
is originated in the right and the female in the left half of the
womb, a fallacy derived originally from Empedocles and Parmenides,
but perpetuated by Latin translations of the Hippocratic treatises
until the seventeenth century. His work was adorned by figures, and
some of these, naturally greatly altered by copyists, but still not
infinitely removed from the facts, have survived in a manuscript of the
ninth century, and give us a distant idea of the appearance of ancient
anatomical drawings.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
We may assist our imagination a little further, in forming an
idea of what such diagrams were like, with the help of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
certain other mediaeval figures representing the form and distribution
of the various anatomical ‘systems’, veins, arteries, nerves, bones,
and muscles which are probably traceable to an Alexandrian origin.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Aretaeus of Cappadocia was probably a contemporary of Galen (second
half of the second century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>). As a clinical author
his reputation stands high, perhaps too high, his descriptions of
pneumonia, emphysema, diabetes, and elephantiasis having especially
drawn attention. In treatment he uses simple remedies, is not affected
by polypharmacy, and suggests many ingenious mechanical devices. It
would appear that Aretaeus is not an independent writer, but mainly a
compiler. He relies largely on Archigenes, a distinguished physician
contemporary with Juvenal, whose works have perished save the fragments
preserved in this manner by Aretaeus and Aetius. Aretaeus was a very
popular writer among the Greeks in all ages, but he was not translated
into Latin, and was unknown in the West until the middle of the
sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
He is philologically interesting as still using the Ionic dialect.</p>

<p>There remains the huge overshadowing figure of Galen. The enormous mass
of the surviving work of this man, the dictator of medicine until the
revival of learning and beyond, tends to throw out of perspective the
whole of Greek medical records. The works of Galen alone form about
half of the mass of surviving Greek medical writings, and occupy, in
the standard edition, twenty-two thick, closely-printed volumes. These
cover every department of medicine, anatomy, physiology, pathology,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
medical theory, therapeutics, as well as clinical medicine and surgery.
In style they are verbose and heavy and very frequently polemical. They
are saturated with a teleology which, at times, becomes excessively
tedious. In the anatomical works, masses of teleological explanation
dilute the account of often imperfectly described structures. Yet to
this element we owe the preservation of the mass of Galen’s works, for
his intensely teleological point of view appealed to the theological
bias both of Western Christianity and of Eastern Islam. Intolerable
as literature, his works are a valuable treasure house of medical
knowledge and experience, custom, tradition, and history.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Hippocratic corpus, so in the case of the
Galenic corpus we are dealing to some extent with material from
various sources. In the case of Galen, however, we have a good
standard of genuineness, for he has left us a list of his books
which can be checked off against those which we actually possess.
The general standpoint of the Galenic is not unlike that of the
Hippocratic writings, but the noble vision of the lofty-minded,
pure-souled physician has utterly passed away. In his place we have
an acute, honest, very contentious fellow, bristling with energy and
of prodigious industry, not unkindly, but loving strife, a thoroughly
‘aggressive’ character. He loves truth, but he loves argument quite
as much. The value of his philosophical writings, of which some have
survived, cannot be discussed here, but it is evident that he is
frequently satisfied with purely verbal explanations. An ingenious
physiologist, a born experimenter, an excellent anatomist and eager
to improve, possessing a good knowledge of the human skeleton and an
accurate acquaintance with the internal parts so far as this can be
derived from a most industrious devotion to dissection of animals,
equipped with all the learning of the schools of Pergamon, Smyrna, and
Alexandria, and rich with the experience of a vast practice at Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Galen is essentially an ‘efficient’ man. He has the grace to
acknowledge constantly and repeatedly his indebtedness to the
Hippocratic writings. Such was the man whose remains, along with the
Hippocratic collection, formed the main medical legacy of Greece to the
Western world.</p>

<p>Some of Galen’s works are mere drug lists, little superior to those
of Dioscorides;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> with the depression
of the intelligence that corresponded with the break up of the Roman
Empire, it was these that were chiefly seized on and distributed in
the West. Attractive too to the debased intellect of the late Roman
world were certain spurious, superstitious, and astrological works that
circulated in the name of Galen and Hippocrates.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
The Greek medical writers after Galen were but his imitators and
abstractors, but through some of them Galen’s works reached the West
at a very early period in the Middle Ages. Such abstractors who were
early translated into Latin were Oribasius (325-403), Paul of Aegina
(625-690), and Alexander of Tralles (525-605). Of the best and most
scientific of Galen’s works the Middle Ages knew little or nothing.</p>

<p>Later Galen and Hippocrates became a little more accessible, not by
translation from the Greek, but by translation from the Arabic of a
Syriac version. The first work to be so rendered was a version of
<i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates which, however, as we have seen, were
already available in Latin dress, together with the Hippocratic
<i>Regimen in acute diseases</i>, and certain works of Galen as corruptly
interpreted by Isaac Judaeus. These were rendered from Arabic into
Latin by Constantine, an African adventurer who became a monk at Monte
Cassino and died there in 1087. Constantine was a wretched craftsman
with an imperfect knowledge of both Arabic and Latin. More effective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
was the great twelfth century translator from the Arabic, Gerard of
Cremona (died 1185), who turned many medical works into Latin from
Arabic, and who was followed by a whole host of imitators. Yet more
important for the advance of medicine, however, was the learned
revival of the thirteenth century. In the main that revival was based
on translations from Arabic, but a certain number of works were
also rendered direct from the Greek. During the thirteenth century
Aristotle’s scientific works began to be treated in this way, but more
important for the course of medicine were those of Galen, and they had
to wait till the following century. The long treatise of Galen, περὶ
χρείας τῶν ἐν ἀνθρώπου σώματι μορίων, <i>On the uses of the bodily parts
in man</i>, was translated from the Greek into Latin by Nicholas of Reggio
in the earlier part of the fourteenth century. This work, with all its
defects, was by far the best account of the human body then available.
Many manuscripts of the Latin version have survived, and it was
translated into several vernaculars, including English, and profoundly
influenced surgery. The rendering into Latin of this treatise, and
its wide distribution, may be regarded as the starting-point of
modern scientific medicine. Its appearance is moreover a part of the
phenomenon of the revived interest in dissection which had begun to be
practised in the Universities in the thirteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
and was a generally accepted discipline in the fourteenth and
fifteenth.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

Until the end of the fifteenth century progress in anatomy was
almost imperceptible. During the fifteenth century more Galenic and
Hippocratic texts were recovered and gradually turned into Latin, but
still without vitally affecting the course of Anatomy. The actual
printing of collected editions of Hippocrates and Galen came rather
late, for the debased taste of the Renaissance physicians continued to
prefer Dioscorides and the Arabs, of whom numerous editions appeared,
so that medicine made no advance corresponding to the progress of
scholarship. The Hippocratic works were first printed in 1525, and an
isolated edition of the inferior Galen in 1490, but the real advance
in Medicine was not made by direct study of these works. So long as
they were treated in the old scholastic spirit such works were of
no more value than those of the Arabists or others inherited from
the Middle Ages. Even Hippocrates can be spoilt by a commentary, and
it was not until the investigator began actually to compare his own
observations with those of Hippocrates and Galen that the real value
of these works became apparent. The department in which this happened
first was Anatomy, and such revolutionaries as Leonardo da Vinci
(1452-1518), who never published, and Vesalius (1514-1564), whose
great work appeared in 1543, were really basing their work on Galen,
though they were much occupied in proving Galen’s errors. Antonio
Benivieni (died 1502), an eager prophet of the new spirit, revived the
Hippocratic tradition by actually collecting notes of a few cases with
accompanying records of deaths and post-mortem findings, among which it
is interesting to observe a case of appendicitis.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
His example was occasionally followed during the sixteenth century,
as for instance, by the Portuguese Jewish physician Amatus Lusitanus
(1511-<i>c.</i> 1562), who printed no fewer than seven hundred cases;
but the real revival of the Hippocratic tradition came in the next
century with Sydenham (1624-1689) and Boerhaave (1668-1738), who were
consciously working on the Hippocratic basis and endeavouring to extend
the Hippocratic experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Lastly surgery came to profit by the revival. The greatest of the
sixteenth century surgeons, the lovable and loving Ambroise Paré
(1510-1590), though he was, as he himself humbly confessed, an ignorant
man knowing neither Latin nor Greek, can be shown to have derived much
from the works of antiquity, which were circulating in translation in
his day and were thus filtering down to the unlearned.</p>

<p>Texts of Hippocrates and of Galen had formed an integral part in the
medical instruction of the universities from their commencement in
the thirteenth century. The first Greek text of the <i>Aphorisms</i> of
Hippocrates appeared in 1532, edited by no less a hand than that of
François Rabelais. With the further recovery of the Greek texts and
preparation of better translations, these became almost the sole mode
of instruction during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The
translators became legion and their competence varied. One highly
skilled translator, however, is of special interest to English
readers. Thomas Linacre (1460?-1524), Physician to Henry VIII, Tutor
to the Princess Mary, founder and first president of the College of
Physicians, a benefactor of both the ancient Universities and one
of the earliest, ablest, most typical, and most exasperating of the
English humanists, spent much energy on this work of translation for
which his abilities peculiarly fitted him. He was responsible for
no less than six important works of Galen, of which one, the <i>De
temperamentis et de inaequali intemperie</i>, printed at Cambridge in
1521, was among the earliest books impressed in that town and is said
to be the first printed in England for which Greek types were used. It
has been honoured by reproduction in facsimile in modern times. Such
works as these, purely literary efforts, had great vogue for a century
and more, and were much in use in the Universities. These humanistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
products sometimes produced, among the advocates of the new scientific
method, a degree of fury which was only rivalled by that of some of
the humanists themselves towards the translators from the Arabic. But
these are now dead fires. As the clinical and scientific methods of
teaching gained ground, textual studies receded in medical education,
as Hippocrates and Galen themselves would have wished them to recede.</p>

<p>The texts of Hippocrates and Galen have now ceased to occupy a place in
any medical curriculum. Yet all who know these writings, know too, not
only that their spirit is still with us, but that the works themselves
form the background of modern practice, and that their very phraseology
is still in use at the bedside. Modern medicine may be truly described
as in essence a creation of the Greeks. To realize the nature of our
medical system, some knowledge of its Greek sources is essential. It
would indeed be a bad day for medicine if ever this debt to the Greeks
were forgotten, and the loss would be at least as much ethical as
intellectual. But there is happily no fear of this, for the figure and
spirit of Hippocrates are more real and living to-day than they have
been since the great collapse of the Greek scientific intellect in the
third and fourth centuries of the Christian era.</p>

The word <i>Biology</i> was introduced by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus
(1776-1837) in his <i>Biologie oder die Philosophie der lebenden Natur</i>,
6 vols., Göttingen, 1802-22, and was adopted by J.-B. de Lamarck
(1744-1829) in his <i>Hydrogéologie</i>, Paris, 1802. It is probable that
the first English use of the word in its modern sense is by Sir William
Lawrence (1783-1867) in his work <i>On the Physiology, Zoology, and
Natural History of Man</i>, London, 1819; there are earlier English uses
of the word, however, contrasted with <i>biography</i>.</p></div>

<i>Historia animalium</i>, v. 6; 541ᵇ 1. The hectocotylization of the
cephalopod arm which is here recorded as an element in the reproductive
process of these animals is denied in the <i>De generatione animalium</i>,
i. 15; 720ᵇ 32, where we read that ‘the insertion of the arm of
the male into the funnel of the female ... is only for the sake of
attachment, and it is not an organ useful for generation, for it is
outside the passage in the male and indeed outside the body of the male
altogether.‘ Yet even here Aristotle knows of the physical relationship
of the arm. See note on this point in the translation of the passage by
A. Platt, Oxford, 1910.</p></div>

The curious word ὀλυνθάζειν, here translated <i>to use the wild fig</i>,
is from ὄλυνθος, a kind of wild fig which seldom ripens. The special
meaning here given to the word is explained in another work of
Theophrastus, <i>De causis plantarum</i>, ii. 9, xv. After describing
caprification in figs, he says τὸ δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν φοινίκων συμβαῖνον οὐ
ταὐτὸν μέν, ἔχει δέ τινα ὁμοιότητα τούτω δι’ ὁ καλοῦσιν ὀλυνθάζειν
αὐτούς. ‘The same thing is not done with dates, but something analogous
to it, whence this is called ὀλυνθάζειν’.</p></div>

The works of Herophilus are lost. This fine passage has been preserved
for us by Sextus Empiricus, a third century physician, in his πρὸς
τοὺς μαθηματικοὺς ἀντιρῥητικοί, which is in essence an attack on all
positive philosophy. It is an entertaining fact that we should have to
go to such a work for remains of the greatest anatomist of antiquity.

The word φυσικός, though it passed over into Latin (Cicero) with the
meaning <i>naturalist</i>, acquired the connotation of <i>sorcerer</i> among the
later Greek writers. Perhaps the word <i>physicianus</i> was introduced to
make a distinction from the charm-mongering <i>physicus</i>. In later Latin
<i>physicus</i> and <i>medicus</i> are almost always interchangeable.</p></div>

This word <i>pronoia</i>, as Galen explains (εἰς τὸ Ἱπποκράτους
προγνωστικόν, K. xviii, B. p. 10), is not used in the philosophic
sense, as when we ask whether the universe was made by chance or by
<i>pronoia</i>, nor is it used quite in the modern sense of <i>prognosis</i>,
though it includes that too. <i>Pronoia</i> in Hippocrates means knowing
things about a patient before you are told them. See E. T. Withington,
‘Some Greek medical terms with reference to Luke and Liddell and
Scott,’ <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine</i> (<i>Section

The ancients knew almost nothing of infection as <i>applied specifically</i>
to disease. All early peoples—including Greeks and Romans—believed in
the transmission of qualities from object to object. Thus purity and
impurity and good and bad luck were infections, and diseases were held
to be infections in that sense. But there is little evidence in the
belief of the special infectivity of <i>disease as such</i> in antiquity.
Some few diseases are, however, unequivocally referred to as infectious
in a limited number of passages, e. g. ophthalmia, scabies, and
phthisis in the περὶ διαφορᾶς πυρετῶν, <i>On the differentiae of fevers</i>,
K. vii, p. 279. The references to infection in antiquity are detailed
by C. and D. Singer, ‘The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro’,
<i>Annals of Medical History</i>, vol. i, New York, 1917.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
